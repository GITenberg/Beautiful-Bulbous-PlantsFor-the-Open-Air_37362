<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>Although many articles have appeared from time to
time in the horticultural newspapers and periodicals
dealing with various aspects of the subject, it cannot
be said that Bulbous Plants have hitherto received
the attention they deserve in gardening literature.
This volume therefore appears at an opportune moment
to meet a recognised want, and in fulfilment of the
promise made in the preface to "<span class="smcap">Beautiful Garden
Flowers</span>."</p>

<p>While Bulbous Plants as a class have been somewhat
neglected, it may be noted that one or two
families have been dealt with specially in years gone
by. In this connection mention may be made of the
magnificent "Monograph of the Genus Lilium," by
Mr. H. J. Elwes; the "Narcissus, its History and
Culture," by Mr. F. W. Burbidge, M.A., and Mr.
J. G. Baker, F.R.S.; a "History of the Genus Crocus,"
by the Hon. and Rev. Dean Herbert, whose original
drawings and MS. notes are preserved in the Lindley
Library. Mr. Geo. Maw has also dealt specially with
the "Crocus"; and more recently the Rev. Eugene
Bourne with the "Daffodil"; Miss Jekyle and
Mr. Goldring with "Lilies," &amp;c.</p>

<p>A glance at the coloured plates will perhaps be
sufficient to give the reader a good idea as to the
numerous kinds of Bulbous Plants now grown in
gardens, and of the marvellous range of colour to be
found in their blossoms. It has not been considered
advisable to include in this volume such hothouse
bulbous plants as Eucharis, Crinum, Hymenocallis,
Pancratium, but only those kinds that are most likely
to give general, if not universal, satisfaction when
grown in the open air according to the cultural
instructions to be found under the heads of the
various genera.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this work I have to
acknowledge my indebtedness to the Director of the
Royal Gardens, Kew, through whose kindness I have
had opportunities for examining the bulbs or corms
of the rarer plants referred to in the letterpress.</p>

<p>I also owe my best thanks for the specimens
kindly supplied to illustrate the work by A. Worsley,
Esq., of Isleworth; Messrs. Barr and Son, of Covent
Garden; Messrs. Wallace and Company, of Colchester;
Messrs. Ware, of Feltham; and Mr. Perry, of
Winchmore Hill.</p>

<h1>BEAUTIFUL BULBOUS PLANTS.</h1>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The cultivation of Bulbous Plants has reached a
point of popularity at the present day that it has
never before attained. And there is every reason to
believe that this popularity is increasing from year to
year as more people become better acquainted with
these plants, and the ease with which the great
majority of them may be grown in almost any garden.
Indeed there are now so many kinds of bulbous
plants that there is no difficulty in making a selection
to suit the smallest garden or the most modest purse.</p>

<p>Of course, some kinds, such as Tulips, Daffodils
and Narcissi, Hyacinths, Crocuses, Snowdrops, Scillas,
Bluebells, Chionodoxas, Grape Hyacinths, Lilies,
Colchicums, Gladioli, and Montbretias, will be always
probably amongst the first favourites with garden
lovers. But there is no reason why the Mariposa
Lilies and Star Tulips, the Brodiæas and Millas, the
Sternbergias and Fritillarias, and many others should<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>
not in the course of time become almost equally
popular when they become better known.</p>

<p>Some kinds of bulbous plants have been known
in British Gardens&mdash;and no doubt in continental ones
also&mdash;ever since such a thing as gardening proper
came to be distinguished from mere agriculture. Our
native or naturalised bulbs&mdash;such as the Snake's Head
Fritillary (<i>Fritillaria Meleagris</i>), the Yellow Star of
Bethlehem (<i>Gagea lutea</i>), as well as the white ones
(<i>Ornithogalum nutans</i>, <i>pyrenaicum</i>, and <i>umbellatum</i>),
the Autumn Crocus (<i>Colchicum autumnale</i>), the Lent
Lily or Daffodil (<i>Narcissus Pseudo-Narcissus</i>), the
Snowdrop (<i>Galanthus nivalis</i>), the Snowflake (<i>Leucojum
vernum</i>), the Grape Hyacinth (<i>Muscari racemosum</i>),
the Squill (<i>Scilla verna</i>), and the Bluebell (<i>S. festalis</i>),
the Martagon Lily (<i>Lilium Martagon</i>), and the <a name="Wild_Tulip" id="Wild_Tulip"></a><a href="#INDEX">Wild Tulip</a>
(<i>Tulipa sylvestris</i>) have been grown as garden plants for 400 years or more.</p>

<p>The great monastic establishments were the seats
of gardening as of learning, and it is in connection
with them we find the first traces of bulbous or any
other plants being intelligently cultivated. Besides
the plants mentioned, our earliest garden records
show that such bulbous plants as the Dog's Tooth
Violet (<i>Erythronium Dens-Canis</i>), the Crown Imperial
(<i>Fritillaria imperialis</i>), <i>Gladiolus communis</i>, the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3] </span>
Garden Hyacinth (<i>Hyacinthus orientalis</i>), the Madonna
Lily (<i>Lilium candidum</i>), the Poet's Narcissus and
the Jonquil (<i>N. poeticus</i> and <i>N. Jonquilla</i>), the Star
Hyacinth (<i>Scilla amoena</i>), the Lily of the Field
(<i>Sternbergia lutea</i>), and Gesner's Tulip (<i>T. Gesneriana</i>),
were among the first kinds cultivated from the beginning of the
16th century, and they are all more popular to-day than ever.
Following these we find such Tulips as <i>suaveolens</i> and <i>Clusiana</i>,
the yellow-flowered Onion (<i>Allium Moly</i>), the Cloth of Gold Crocus
(<i>C. Susianus</i>), the Byzantine Gladiolus (<i>G. byzantinus</i>), and others in the
17th century. The beginning of the 18th century saw the introduction
to our gardens of the Belladonna Lily (<i>Amaryllis Belladonna</i>),
and later on the Babianas, Ixias, and other Gladioli like <i>blandus</i>,
<i>cuspidatus</i>, and <i>cardinalis</i>.</p>

<p>It is to the 19th century, however, that we owe
not only many introductions of new kinds, but also
the development of the great enterprise that has been
shown in their extensive cultivation, and the natural
methods of using them in the garden.</p>

<p>To this period, and especially to the latter half of
it, belong most of our fine Lilies, Bulbous Irises,
Mariposa Lilies and Star Tulips, Brodiæas,
Chionodoxas, Scillas, and American Dog's Tooth
Violets. It has also been the age when the florist's<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4] </span>
varieties of Gladiolus, Daffodils, Tulips, Hyacinths,
and Crocuses have been brought almost, if not quite,
to the acme of perfection by intelligent cultivation and
careful selection.</p>

<p>All this has led to the growth of many kinds of
bulbous plants having become a huge industry. Dutch
bulbs have for many generations been famous, and many
kinds will, no doubt, continue to retain their hold upon
the public owing to the undoubted advantage of the climate
under which they are grown. But experience has proved that
such bulbous plants as Tulips and Daffodils at least can
be grown equally well in some parts of the British Islands,
notably in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, the Scilly Isles, and parts of
Ireland. It has been stated that over five hundred millions
of bulbs are used for decorative purposes in Great Britain
alone every year, and that the value of imported bulbs ranges
from £5,000,000 to £8,000,000 annually.</p>

<p>The growth of Daffodils and Narcissi alone in the
<a name="Scilly_Isle" id="Scilly_Isle"></a><a href="#INDEX">Scilly Isles</a> within the past forty years has been
nothing less than phenomenal. Mr. T. A. Dorrien-Smith,
of Tresco Abbey, has stated that the first lot
of flowers was sent to Covent Garden Market about
1865, and realised £1. It was not, however, until
about 1880 that Daffodil growing in these Islands<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5] </span>
became at all remunerative, and some idea of their
growth since then may be gained from the fact
(vouched for by the same authority) that 65 tons of
flowers were exported from the Scilly Isles in 1885,
85 tons in 1886, 100 tons in 1887, 188 tons in 1888,
and 198 tons in 1889; and on one day alone&mdash;the
25th February, 1896&mdash;30-½ tons of Narcissi, comprising
3,258,000 blooms in 4,849 boxes, were shipped to
Penzance for market. Cultivation on such an extensive
scale, of course, means a considerable reduction
in price, and, from a commercial point of view, ordinary
Daffodil growing may be said to have reached bedrock
prices a long time ago.</p>

<p>However, of late years, our American cousins have
taken a keen interest in the importation of bulbs from
Europe, and as gardening is a comparatively new
industry in that extensive country, we may expect
that it will afford a good market for many years to
come. Not many years ago certain kinds of Tulips,
Daffodils, Hyacinths, &amp;c., were a drug in the English
markets, and could be had at a very low price. Since,
however, the Americans have become fond of bulb-growing,
these particular kinds have advanced considerably
in price, in some cases 100 to 150 per cent.,
because it so happened they were just the sorts that
were liked on the other side of the Atlantic.</p><br>



<br>
<h2><a name="GEOGRAPHICAL_DISTRIBUTION" id="GEOGRAPHICAL_DISTRIBUTION"></a>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.</h2><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6] </span></p>


<p>It is curious to note in this respect that almost
every part of the temperate and sub-tropical regions
of the globe have contributed some class of bulbous
plants now to be found in cultivation. Central and
Southern Europe and Northern Africa have supplied
us with various Daffodils and Narcissi, Tulips, &amp;c.
From Asia Minor and Turkestan, the Chionodoxas,
and many bulbous Irises and Fritillarias have been
introduced. California and other parts of North
America have produced the Mariposa Lilies, all
the Dog's Tooth Violets, except the common British
one, the Brodiæas, &amp;c.; while South Africa has
given us the Gladiolus, Montbretias, and Tritonias,
Crocosma, and other beautiful plants. And the
Lilies, which form a large group in themselves,
are to be found in almost every temperate clime
north of the equator (see <a href="#Page_95">page 95</a>).</p>

<p>When these facts are borne in mind, the reader
will readily understand the necessity of trying to
imitate, as far as possible, in our own climate the
various natural conditions under which these plants
are found.</p>

<P>There is so much confusion of thought as to what
a "bulbous" plant really is, that it may be as well
at the beginning of this volume to endeavour to
clear up the haziness that exists in regard to the
matter. It seems to be taken for granted that any
plant with a swollen or thickened stem or rootstock is
a "bulbous" one. And this impression is no doubt
confirmed when one consults the bulb catalogues
issued by nurserymen. In these publications&mdash;chiefly,
no doubt, for the sake of convenience and to avoid
unnecessary extra expense in printing&mdash;a large number
of plants are enumerated as if they were really bulbous.
It is, therefore, not at all unnatural that the amateur
should come to the conclusion that everything mentioned
between the covers of a bulb catalogue should
be truly bulbous in nature. Even some publications
on bulbous plants have adopted the same loose
nomenclature. Thus we find such non-bulbous plants
as Aconites, Anemones, Dahlias, Dicentras, Day-Lilies,
Hepaticas, Solomon's Seal, Astilbe japonica, Tropæolums,
Lily of the Valley, Corydalis, Torch Lilies, Pæonies,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8] </span>
Christmas Roses, and many others described as "bulbous"
plants, while some that are really so, and worthy of
cultivation, are not even mentioned.</p>

<p>Some of the plants referred to above have thickened
stems or roots, and will be found described in their
proper places in the companion volume to this&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Beautiful
Garden Flowers</span>." They belong to several
different families of plants. True bulbous plants,
however (with which we may include those having
"corms"), are confined to very few families. Indeed,
they are restricted to one of the two large groups of
flowering plants, viz., that in which the leaves usually
have parallel veins, and the flowers have their parts
in circles of three or six. This group of plants is
known to botanists as "monocotyledons," and is still
further distinguished by having only <i>one</i> seed-leaf, as
may be seen when the seeds of any of them sprout,
as shown in the Tulip, <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>.</p>

<p>It is within the limits of this definition, therefore,
that all the plants described in this book come. They
all have parallel-veined leaves, and the parts of their
flowers are in "threes" or "sixes," as may be seen
by consulting the coloured plates.</p>

<p>There is an apparent contradiction to this rule in
the Daffodils (Narcissi) in which the "trumpet" or
"corona" in the centre makes a seventh organ. A<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9] </span>
similar growth may be seen in such bulbous plants as
the Eucharis, Hymenocallis, Pancratium, &amp;c., that are
usually grown under glass. This corona is analogous
to the ligules or scale-like outgrowths so noticeable on
the petals of the Campions (Lychnis), the chief
difference being that in the Narcissi the ligules are
joined together, become much larger, and often constitute
the most attractive feature of the flowers.</p><br>

<p><b>Definition of a "Bulb."</b>&mdash;Perhaps the very best-known
example of a true bulb is the common or
garden Onion. Another example is shown in the
sketch of a Hyacinth and Tigridia.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" width="450" height="260" alt="Tunicated Bulb of Hyacinth

<table class=narrowcaption summary=""><tr><td>Tunicated Bulb of Hyacinth
in section showing &quot;Disc,&quot; and
Scale Leaves s. l.</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Tigridia Bulb,
Showing thick Contractile Roots.
</td></tr></table>

<p>The bulbs of Daffodils, Tulips, Snowdrops, Scillas,
&amp;c., all conform very closely to the Onion in structure.
It will be noticed that at the base of the
Hyacinth, for example, is a flattish or deltoid mass of
tissue. This is called the "disc" and is really the
stem portion of the bulb. On the upper surface it
bears a number of thick scaly leaves packed very
close together, and rolled round each other, with the
flower-spike in the centre; while from the under
surface, the roots emanate when growth takes place.
It may be easily imagined by the reader that if the
"disc" were drawn out lengthwise, and if a space
separated one scale-leaf from another, that the bulb
would be very similar in appearance to an ordinary<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10] </span>
leafy stem. Nature, however, has a certain object in
view in modifying the stems and leaves in such a
manner that they are tightly packed away when at
rest, within a brown protecting coat, so that they
resemble the large scale-protected flower-buds that
may be seen in winter on Horse-chestnuts, Lilacs,
Ash, &amp;c. The thick scale-leaves are really storehouses
in which food has been stored up by the larger
and broader green leaves that perform the functions
of assimilation, respiration, &amp;c., above the
ground during the growing period.</p>

<p>When the bulb begins to grow, the food in the
thick scale-leaves is drawn up to supply nourishmentx
to the flower-stem, until the new green leaves can<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11] </span>
manufacture or elaborate a fresh supply in the sunlight
from the raw materials drafted into them from
the soil by the roots. Under favourable circumstances
more food is elaborated than is necessary for the
wants of the plant, and then extra growths or young
bulbs called "offsets" are developed at the base, or
rather the side, of the older bulb.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned here, however, that all
bulbs do not vegetate in the same way. In many
cases the original bulb persists for several seasons, as
in the Daffodil and Hyacinth, for example; but in
others it vanishes completely during the period of
growth, and is absorbed, or swallowed up, as it were,
by the flower stem. The most common example of
this among bulbs is the Tulip, to which more detailed
reference has been made at <a href="#Page_133">p. 133</a>.</p><br>

<p><b>Kinds of Bulbs.</b>&mdash;Most true bulbs are constructed
like the Onion, Daffodil, Snowdrop, or Hyacinth, in
having the scale-leaves rolled round each other, forming
different layers or coats. Such bulbs are said to
be "tunicated." In the case of the Liliums, however,
the scale-leaves only lap over each other at the edges,
and are arranged spirally round the central axis.
These bulbs are called "scaly," or "imbricated," and
are shown in the annexed sketch on <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>.</p>

<p>The individual scales are much thicker at the base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a> </span>
than at the apex, and in the case of tunicated bulbs,
they are also thicker on one side than the other. By
this arrangement, the various "coats" can be rolled
round each other more tightly, and without wasting
any space.</p>

<p><a name="Definition_of_a_Corm" id="Definition_of_a_Corm"></a><b><a href="#INDEX">Definition of a "Corm.</a>"</b>&mdash;In outward appearance,
many corms are so much like bulbs, that the two
terms are interchangeable and loosely applied, at
least, among gardeners. By cutting a "corm" through
the centre lengthwise, a great difference, however,
will be noticed in the structure. In the bulb, the
"disc" is small and unimportant, while the scale-leaves
upon it are the most conspicuous feature. In
the "corm," on the other hand, the "disc" is the
all-important feature, and is devoid of any thick scale-leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a>  </span>
upon it. The new growths appear on the top
or sides, and the lines round the circumference show
where the sheathing papery scale-leaves were
attached. In the "corm" then, it is the disc, and
not the scale-leaves, that is the great storehouse
of food.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Growth of a Corm.</b>&mdash;The vegetation of the corm is
very remarkable, and somewhat resembles that of the
Tulip. When a corm commences to grow, the reserve
material within it is used up for the benefit of the
flowers and leaves. The result of this absorbing
process is that by the end of the season the old corm
has almost vanished, or is reduced to a dry shrivelled,
woody, and lifeless mass, incapable of further growth,
and attached to the base of the new corms, as
shown in the annexed sketches of Gladiolus and
Crocus on <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>.</p>

<p>These new corms are the direct result of the
work that has been done by the green leaves in the
daylight, and after a period of rest, they go through
precisely the same process the following season&mdash;vanishing
themselves, but leaving others behind to
carry on the work of producing flowers, and, if
possible, seeds.</p>

to Bulbs and Corms.</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a>  </span>
&mdash;If the reader wishes to be successful in growing
bulbous plants in his garden he must have very great
respect for the green leaves of his plants, and always
endeavour to keep them in the cleanest and healthiest
possible condition. From what has just been said
about the production of new bulbs in the Tulip, and
new corms in the Crocus and Gladiolus, it is obvious
that the leaves play a most important part. Indeed,
without their aid there would be neither bulbs nor
corms to carry on the work of the plants from year
to year. In the form of carbon-dioxide the leaves eat
up the carbon and oxygen from the atmosphere.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15] </span>
Under the influence of sunlight the gas is decomposed,
so that the oxygen is given off again into the
air, while the carbon is retained for the production of
starch and other materials. These are elaborated in
the cells of the leaves, and after undergoing certain
changes pass down the stems and are stored up in the
bulbs or corms beneath the surface of the soil. It is
only <i>green</i> healthy leaves that can perform this
important work satisfactorily. When the foliage
therefore begins to turn yellow and wither, it may be
taken for granted that its work for the season is
coming to a close, and the bulbs or corms are going
to enjoy a well-earned rest. It should, perhaps, be
mentioned also that leaves can only become green in
day light; and although some bulbous plants like
a certain amount of shade, it would never do to
exclude the light from them altogether, or even
to plant them in places where they could not get
an adequate amount of sunshine, or diffused light,
during the day.</p><br>

<h2><a name="SOIL_FOR_BULBOUS_PLANTS" id="SOIL_FOR_BULBOUS_PLANTS"></a><a href="#INDEX">SOIL FOR BULBOUS PLANTS.</a></h2><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a>  </span></p>

<p>Comparatively few of the bulbous plants mentioned
in this volume will require anything better
than ordinary good garden soil that has been deeply
dug, contains a certain amount of well-decomposed
manure, and is well-drained so that the water freely
passes away. Such a soil will give general satisfaction,
with the least amount of trouble, especially if it
is inclined to be light rather than heavy.</p>

<p>To secure really first-class results, however, the
soil in beds or borders that are to be planted with
bulbs should be particularly well-prepared in advance.
A heavy soil, that is, one inclined to hold water, and
of a clayey nature, will require a good deal more
labour to bring it into a proper condition than a soil
that is already friable and in a fair state of tilth.
The heavy soil should be not only deeply dug to a
depth of two feet or more, taking care not to bring the
lower layers to the surface in the operation, although
they should be turned over and pulverised as much as
possible where they are. Plenty of sand or road-grit
should be incorporated with a heavy soil, not only to
keep it "open," but also to increase its warmth&mdash;a
matter of some importance in our cold wet winters.
The upper layer of soil, say a foot from the surface,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17] </span>
may be still further improved by the admixture of old
cow-manure and soot. In very bad soils, powdered
quicklime may also be added, not only to absorb
superfluous moisture, but to render the soil sweeter
and more fertile. On no account, however, should
fresh, rank manure be dug into the soil just before
the bulbs are planted, as the heat and gases generated
by its decomposition are often injurious to the
extremely tender tips of the young roots.</p>

<p>An ordinary good garden soil&mdash;that is, one that is
regularly dug, hoed, manured, and cropped with some
class of plants&mdash;will only need to be well dug for
bulbs, and to have some well-decayed manure and
soot incorporated with it a week or two before
planting. For some bulbs, such as the Mariposa
Lilies (Calochorti), some of the bulbous Irises, and a
few other kinds, it may be necessary to take particular
pains with the preparation of the soil for
them. Attention has been specially called to
plants of this nature, where such has been considered
necessary. It should be remembered that when
bulbous plants are attacked by fungoid diseases,
referred to at <a href="#Page_145">p. 145</a>, it is very often the result of a
badly prepared soil, and not to any inherent defect
in the bulbs.</p><br>

<h2><a name="HINTS_TO_BEGINNERS" id="HINTS_TO_BEGINNERS"></a><a href="#INDEX">HINTS TO BEGINNERS.</a></h2><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 18] </span>

<p>There is a beginning to everything, and the
cultivation of bulbous plants is no exception to
the rule. It is probable in many cases that the
beginner at bulb-growing falls into precisely the same
errors as the beginner with other classes of plants.
The most common error of all, perhaps, is that he
wants to grow at once every bulbous plant known.
He sees a book, like the present one for example, and
admires the beautiful pictures of bulbous plants in it.
The result may be&mdash;and I hope it will be&mdash;a keen desire
to invest in the bulbs that can produce such charming
blossoms. But this keen desire should be tempered
with discretion. His garden may be only a small one,
and perhaps already stocked with many other plants.
As he cannot hope to get the whole of Kew Gardens
into it at once, it would be as well to start with only
a few <i>kinds</i> of bulbs. I do not mean of a <i>few bulbs</i> of
<i>many</i> kinds, as he is almost sure to be disappointed
in the results. In these days of imperial thought it
is no use thinking of producing an effect in a garden
with six bulbs of either Snowdrops, Crocuses, Tulips,
or Daffodils. It is as well to think of the larger
bulbs like the Lilies and choice Hyacinths in <i>dozens</i>;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19] </span>
of the medium sized ones like Tulips, Daffodils,
Tritonias, and bedding Hyacinths in <i>hundreds</i>; and
of the smaller ones like Crocuses, Snowdrops, Spanish
Irises, Scillas, Chionodoxas, and Bluebells in <i>thousands</i>.
The dearer and choicer kinds are better left alone,
perhaps, until some advance has been made with the
others.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Buying_Bulbs" id="Buying_Bulbs"></a><a href="#INDEX">Buying Bulbs.</a></b>&mdash;To buy bulbous plants in dozens,
hundreds, or thousands of course means money. The
beginner, however, is not advised to buy large quantities
of <i>all</i> the kinds mentioned to begin with, as the
cost might be prohibitive, or the convenience for their
proper treatment inadequate. What is strongly recommended,
however, is to start with a large number
of any one, two, or three kinds as can be afforded
one year, instead of frittering away the same amount
of money over a few bulbs each of perhaps a dozen
different kinds which will fail to produce the anticipated
effect later on. It is much better, for instance,
to buy, say 100 bulbs of cottage or Mayflowering
Tulips, than to invest in 100 bulbs belonging to eight
different genera.</p>

<p>The 100 Tulips would make a fine show in the
garden, because there would probably be enough of
them; whereas the other bulbs, although quite as<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20] </span>
handsome in their own way would be lost, or at least
inconspicuous, owing to the small number of each in
flower at the same time.</p>

<p>If only one or two kinds of bulbs can be bought
in sufficient quantity each season, with care they can
be increased each year afterwards, and need not be
purchased again. This will permit of the purchase
of a sufficient number of one or two other kinds the
following year, and as these will increase and multiply
in the same way, there will be quite a large number
of excellent bulbs available at the end of a few years.
Each season there is a larger and better display than
the preceding one, and that is a result very rarely
attained, even after several years' labour, and a lot
of money has been spent, when the principle of
having only a <i>few</i> bulbs of <i>many</i> kinds is adopted.</p>

<p>If the effect is not produced the first season,
enthusiasm is likely to be killed, or the interest
in bulb-growing may be seriously diminished.</p>

<p>The beginner is strongly advised to start with
such easily-grown and effective bulbs as Tulips, Daffodils,
and Spanish Irises, afterwards adding Montbretias
or Tritonias, Gladiolus, Liliums, Chionodoxas,
Scillas, Snowdrops, Grape Hyacinths, Crocuses, &amp;c.,
according to fancy. Of course all these may be
started with, but as stated before, each kind should be
purchased in sufficient quantity to make a bold and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21] </span>
effective display when in blossom.</p>

<p><b>A Word of Warning.</b>&mdash;Beginners must not run
away with the idea that the largest bulbs give the
most blossom. In many instances this is very far
from being the case&mdash;notably with the florists'
Hyacinth&mdash;which is a most deceptive bulb. Small
heavy bulbs are much better than large light ones&mdash;that
is light or heavy according to their size. In
Daffodils, too, there is a good deal of variety in the
shape and size of different varieties, some being
naturally smaller than others, and yet capable of
throwing fine blossoms. All healthy bulbs, no matter
to what genus they belong, should be firm and solid,
and not soft and pappy to the touch. A distinction
must also be made between well-ripened "flowering
bulbs," and those often advertised as "planting
bulbs." The latter are perfectly sound, but being
merely offsets from the "flowering" bulbs, are not
likely to flower the first year after planting, although
a few of the stronger ones may do so. When
one can afford to await a couple of years, "planting"
bulbs offer a cheap means of stocking a garden,
as a thousand can be purchased for a few
shillings.</p>

<p>The other hints, necessary for a beginner, will be
found in the following pages attached to the different<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22] </span>
groups of bulbs or corms he may wish to grow.</p><br>



<br>
<h2><a name="HOW_DEEP_SHOULD_BULBS_BE_PLANTED" id="HOW_DEEP_SHOULD_BULBS_BE_PLANTED"></a><a href="#INDEX">HOW DEEP SHOULD BULBS BE PLANTED?</a></h2>

<p>This question has been agitating the minds of
gardeners for some considerable time, and has given
rise to a certain amount of discussion. Some advocate
very deep planting, on the strength of having
discovered the bulbs of such plants as Snowdrops,
&amp;c., a foot or more beneath the surface of the soil
without any decrease in vigour. On the contrary, it
has been contended that the plants have shown
unusual sturdiness, notwithstanding the amount of
reserve material the bulbs must have expended before
the leaves were able to reach the light. It is natural
that bulbs that are left in beds and borders for a few
years without lifting should be found at a greater
depth than is generally recommended for the planting
of new bulbs. In the course of time the soil is turned
up more or less deeply, and any bulbs in it are
almost sure to be buried deeper than they were
before; or frequent top dressings of soil or manure
may have been given, and thus place the bulbs still
further from the light. It is possible, however, that
bulbs get buried deeply owing to the downward pull<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23] </span>
of their own contractile roots referred to below.</p>

<p>Although I am not going to recommend very deep
planting, there is one great advantage in having bulbs
in the open air well covered with soil, viz., that the
temperature of the soil at one, two, or three feet is
often as much as 20 degrees higher than it is immediately
on the surface during very cold and frosty
weather. This is a wonderful provision of Nature
for the protection of all kinds of roots and bulbs
beneath the soil in winter.</p>

<p>In the following pages the average size of the bulbs
or corms of different genera is given. It will be
noticed that they vary from half an inch in diameter
in some of the smaller Narcissi, to three, four, or five
inches in some of the Liliums. Between these two
extremes there are nearly all shapes and sizes, and it
is not unnatural that the amateur should be somewhat
puzzled as to the depth he ought to plant any particular
bulb.</p>

<p>For planting bulbs in the open air, I venture to
propound a safe general rule, viz.:&mdash;<i>cover a bulb or
corm with about twice its own depth of soil</i>. Thus a
bulb one inch through from top to bottom would be
planted about three inches deep, so that it would be
covered with two inches of soil. The adoption of
this principle means fairly deep planting in the case<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24] </span>
of large bulbs. There are a few exceptions, however,
to this rule, but they have been noted in the proper
place.</p>

<p>The actual planting of bulbs in formal beds may
be done with either a garden trowel or dibber. The
trowel is better for the larger bulbs like Liliums, and
may of course be used for smaller bulbs if found to be
more convenient. The dibber is useful for making
holes at very regular distances apart in the lines, and
into each hole a bulb may be dropped in, afterwards
covering it over with soil.</p>

<p>A blunt dibber as shown in the sketch, will be<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25] </span>
found more useful than a pointed one for the work,
although it may not be pushed into the soil so readily.
The danger of a sharp-pointed dibber is shown in the
sketch. A fairly large bulb is liable to be hung up
in the hole as its diameter is greater than that of the
dibber at a certain depth. Under these circumstances
roots would not be emitted so readily from the base,
as when the bulb is resting flat on the bottom of the
hole as shown in the sketch to the right.</p>

<p>In connection with the question of planting,
attention may be directed to a very interesting and
remarkable power possessed by the roots of many
bulbs and corms. A glance at the sketches of
Gladiolus, Tritonia, Nothoscordum, and Lilium, will
show the reader some thick fleshy roots with conspicuous
rings on them. They are readily distinguished
from the finer fibrous roots, and, as may be
readily supposed, their functions are quite distinct.
To thoroughly understand what these thick-ringed
roots are for, the reader will remember what has been
said at <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a> about the way in which the old
corms of Crocuses and Gladioli disappear, or are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a>  </span>
surmounted in autumn by new ones. If the plants
were not disturbed for several years, one would
imagine that as the new corms were always produced
<i>on top</i> of the old ones, they would sooner or later
come through the surface of the soil, and thus run the
risk of being either parched by drought, or shrivelled
up by the heat of the summer sun; or, again, of being
frozen to death in winter. And yet, examination of
the corms will show that the new ones are quite as
deep down in the soil, if not deeper, than their predecessors.
This remarkable state of affairs to preserve
what may be called the <i>status quo</i> is entirely
due to the action of the thick, ringed roots referred to
above. These roots usually strike straight down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a>  </span>
the soil. When they have gone as far as Nature
intended them to, they begin to contract much in the
same way apparently as a worm does when going into
its burrow, and for this reason they have been called
"<a href="#INDEX">contractile</a>."</p>

</td></tr></table>


<p>During the process of contraction a tremendous
force must be exerted to enable the roots to pull the
corms or bulbs down to their proper level in the soil.
The passive resistance of the latter is overcome, and
as a result its particles are pressed much closer
together than they were before.</p>

<p>Sometimes this pulling power of the roots is
exerted horizontally instead of vertically, and this
accounts for the spreading of many bulbous plants
like Tulips, Grape Hyacinths, &amp;c., over a large area
in the course of a few years when left undisturbed.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Bulbous_Plants_without_Contractile_Roots" id="Bulbous_Plants_without_Contractile_Roots"></a>Bulbous Plants without Contractile Roots.</b>&mdash;Some

<p>A glance at the sketches of Colchicum and Bulbocodium
will show a peculiar method of growth.
The new corm instead of being produced on top of
the old one, is developed at the side. Note, however,
that the new corm is not on the same level as the old
one. That would be no advantage whatever. Therefore<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28] </span>
it takes, as it were, a step <i>downwards</i>, so as to be
well out of reach of mowing machines, rats, and mice,
and other enemies, and also probably because it knows
it will be much warmer in winter when several inches
below the surface. The same principle seems to be
employed by the bulbs of the Dog's Tooth Violets
(<i>Erythronium</i>), as may be seen from the sketch&mdash;the
new bulb to the right being distinctly lower than the
older one to the left.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no one class of plants that have
so many ways of being easily increased as bulbous
plants proper. Some kinds, <i>e.g.</i>, Liliums, Alliums,
may be increased in four different ways&mdash;from offsets
and "spawn," scales, bulbils, and, last of all, seeds.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Offsets" id="Offsets"></a><a href="#INDEX">Offsets.</a></b>&mdash;The great mass of bulbous and cormous
plants, however, are so readily multiplied by detaching
the offsets from the parent bulb or corm, that the
other methods are rarely employed except by trade
growers. Nearly all hardy bulbous plants produce
offsets freely. These offsets represent a superabundance
of nourishment that has been elaborated in the
leaves, and very often there are several smaller ones
attached to the base of the larger ones that have been
produced in precisely the same way.</p>

<p>In the case of Daffodils, Tulips, Hyacinths,
Crocuses, Gladiolus, and a host of others, the new
offsets are pressed against the sides or on top of the
older ones. In the drawing of the Tulip (<a href="#Page_30">p. 30</a>), three
new bulbs are to be seen surrounding all that is left of
the old bulb. This latter has practically vanished up
the main axis from the disc to produce flowers and
leaves&mdash;hence it follows that the Tulip bulb somewhat
resembles the corm in its vegetative characters. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a>  </span>
bulbs taken out of the soil in early summer are not
those that were planted the previous autumn.</p>

<p>Besides "offsets," some plants produce numerous
small vegetative bodies called "<a name="cloves" id="cloves"></a><a href="#INDEX">cloves</a>" or "spawn."
These are shown in the drawing of the Gladiolus (<a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>),
where two strong flowering corms have been developed
on top of the old shrivelled one. At the base of each of
these are numerous small outgrowths among the contractile
roots. If these growths or spawn are taken
off and stored in sandy soil until spring, they may
then be planted in special beds, and in the course of
two or three years will reach the flowering size.</p>

</div>

<p>The Liliums are a large and interesting group of
bulbous plants. Many of them produce offsets freely
round the base of the old bulb. There are several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a>  </span>
species, however (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>canadense</i>, <i>Grayi</i>, <i>maritimum</i>,
<i>pardalinum</i>, <i>Parryi</i>, <i>superbum</i>), which have creeping
rootstocks or rhizomes, and the new offsets are produced
along these at intervals as shown in the drawing.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Division" id="Division"></a>Division.</b>&mdash;Bulbs or corms are rarely cut up for
purposes of propagation. The best example in which
this method of increase is practised is the Gladiolus.
The larger corms, if they show two or more crown-growths,
may be carefully cut down between them
with a sharp knife. The cut surfaces may be dipped
in soot, not only to dry it more rapidly, but also to
prevent any stray spores of fungoid diseases from
germinating.</p>

</div><br>

<p><b><a name="Leaf-Scales" id="Leaf-Scales"></a><a href="#INDEX">Leaf-Scales.</a></b>&mdash;The thick, fleshy, deltoid scales of
many of the Liliums will develop buds at the base, as
shown in the drawing, when detached and inserted
almost vertically in sandy soil. In about three or
four years flowering bulbs can be produced by this
means.</p>

<p>A somewhat analogous process is adopted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a>  </span>
Hyacinths. The old bulb is slashed across the base
of the disc two or three times into the fleshy scales.
The cut surfaces dry up, and by-and-bye small buds
or bulblets, as shown on the sketch of the Lily scale,
make their appearance. In due course these bulblets
are detached and planted in light sandy soil. The
propagation of the florists' varieties of Hyacinths
by this means is not altogether satisfactory, as the
old bulbs themselves undergo a deterioration in our
variable climate.</p>

<p><b><a name="Bulbils" id="Bulbils"></a><a href="#INDEX">Bulbils.</a></b>&mdash;These are vegetative growths&mdash;neither
seeds, bulbs, nor offsets&mdash;that appear in the axils of the
aërial leaves, as shown in the sketch. Many Liliums,
like <i>bulbiferum</i>, <i>tigrinum</i>, <i>speciosum</i>, <i>Leichtlini</i>, and
some of the Alliums produce them with great
regularity. It is thought that bulbils are borne by
some plants and not others, because the conditions for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>
the fertilisation or ripening of the seeds are not
favourable. In such cases, therefore, Nature has
provided such plants with this means of reproduction
by bulbils, rather than allow them to run the risk of
dying out altogether. In Kerner and Oliver's "Natural
History of Plants" it is stated that "There are two
forms of Orange Lily indigenous to Europe. One
(<i>Lilium croceum</i>), occurring especially in the Pyrenees
and South of France, almost always ripens fruits and
forms no bulbils in its leaf-axils. The other (<i>Lilium
bulbiferum</i>), found in the valleys of the Central and
Northern Alps, hardly ever fruits, but is characterised
by the bulbils it produces in the axils of its leaves;
bulbils which disarticulate in autumn and are scattered
by the wind. But there is no difference noticeable in
the structure of the flowers in these two Orange
Lilies, and it is difficult to explain their difference in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a>  </span>
mode of propagation, save on the assumption that in
the regions where <i>Lilium bulbiferum</i> grows those insects
are wanting which should convey its pollen from
flower to flower. As the Orange Lily possesses no
arrangements for autogamy (<i>i.e</i>., self-fertilisation), no
fruits are formed in the absence of insect visits. It
appears that this plant has lost the capacity for
autogamy; at any rate, if a stigma be pollinated with
pollen from the same flower on plants in a garden, no
result follows. On the other hand, offshoots in the
form of numerous bulbils are produced by <i>Lilium
bulbiferum</i>, by means of which it is propagated and
dispersed. In several valleys of the Central Alps
it does not flower at all, and thus obviously depends
entirely upon its bulbils for propagation."</p>

<span class="caption">Bulbils in leaf-axils.</span>
</div>

<p>The bulbils should not be detached from the stems
until the latter are quite ripe, and the foliage shows
signs of withering. They may be sown as if they
were large seeds. They possess the advantage over
seeds, however, inasmuch as they produce flowering
bulbs two or three seasons before the bulbs from real
seeds come to maturity.</p>

<p><b>Bulbous Plants from Seeds.</b>&mdash;The
would-be raiser of bulbous plants from seeds must be gifted with a
good deal of patience, and be systematic in his
methods, otherwise he will find it is no sinecure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a>  </span>
wait from five to ten years before a flower appears
from the seeds he sowed at the beginning of those
periods. Even when the blossoms do appear, the
great majority of them are likely to be inferior in
almost every way to their progenitors. The raising
of bulbous plants from seeds, therefore, is not likely
to find many enthusiastic disciples among amateur
growers, who, as a rule, are content to cultivate the
varieties that have been evolved by generations
of gardeners. Under these circumstances
it is most fortunate that bulbous plants can be
so readily multiplied by offsets. Of course, in
large gardens and nurseries, where there is
a trained staff of men, it is a comparatively
easy matter to save and sow a certain quantity
of seeds each year. After the first period
of waiting is over, each season sees a fresh
lot of seedlings burst into blossom. Any
particularly fine forms are marked, and afterwards
increased by means of the offsets or
bulbils.</p>

<p>The annexed drawing shows a seedling
Tulip. The germination is very similar to
that of the common garden Onion. The
swollen portion at the base represents the
first stage in the development of the bulb, and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a>  </span>
year for six or seven seasons sees it increase in size,
and ultimately large and strong enough to blossom.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Sowing_Seeds" id="Sowing_Seeds"></a><a href="#INDEX">Sowing Seeds.</a></b>&mdash;The seeds of all the perfectly
hardy bulbous plants may be sown in the open air, in
beds specially prepared for the purpose. The soil
should be a light sandy loam with a good sprinkling
of leaf-mould in it. The "drills" may be drawn about
one inch deep, and as the seedlings in many cases are
left to look after themselves until they bloom, the
seeds should be sown very thinly&mdash;two or three inches
apart&mdash;so as to allow for future development. It
would scarcely be wise, in the case of choice or rare
varieties, to trust the seeds to the open air. They
may, however, be sown in pots or pans, and after two
or three seasons' growth they will be large enough for
transferring to the open air. The seeds of bulbous
plants may be sown in spring if they ripen late in the
year; or in early autumn if they ripen in summer.</p><br>

<p>As all bulbous plants have a period of rest at some
season of the year, it is a matter of some little importance
whether the bulbs or corms in the soil shall be
taken up, or left in the ground from year to year. It<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37] </span>
will be noticed in many instances in the following
pages that certain kinds are recommended to be left
in the ground for three or four seasons without being
disturbed. This practice may be adopted with advantage
when bulbs are naturalised in the grass, the
rock-garden, by the sides of lakes, &amp;c., and in thin
shrubberies or borders, where they are not likely to
be rooted up during the year.</p>

<p>In the formal flower beds, however, in which
Tulips, Daffodils, Hyacinths, Crocuses, &amp;c., are planted
for a display in spring and early summer, it is necessary
to lift them after flowering, not only to make way
for the summer "bedding" plants, but also to allow
of the beds being re-dug and re-arranged if necessary.</p>

<p>The best time for lifting the bulbs is usually when
the leaves have commenced to turn yellow. Some do
this earlier than others, but in all cases, it is a sign
that growth has ceased, and that bulbs or corms in
the soil are ripe, and will be improved by a period of
rest.</p>

<p><b>Storing.</b>&mdash;When lifted by means of a fork, the
bulbs may be spread out to dry, either in the sun, or
in some dry and airy shed. After a few days they
may be gone over and cleaned by hand, taking off the
old leaves, and putting the offsets or bulbils in
separate receptacles from the large and well-ripened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a>  </span>
bulbs that are to be used for next year's display.
The bulbs lifted in early summer (<i>e.g.</i>, Tulips,
Daffodils, Hyacinths, &amp;c.) may be spread out in thin
layers&mdash;not heaps&mdash;upon shelves in a cool, airy shed,
where they can remain without injury until the time
of planting in autumn comes round.</p>

<p>In the case of bulbs or corms that are lifted in
autumn when the leaves begin to fade, like the
Gladiolus, the same process of cleaning is gone through,
but care must be taken to keep them where the frost
will not touch them during the winter. It is a good
plan to store them in dry sand or earth in shallow
boxes, and place them in dry, airy cellars or sheds
until the spring.</p><br>

<p>While bulbous plants alone, especially when used
in large quantities, make an effective display in the
garden, they can be made much more attractive by
the exercise of a little art and a pleasing combination
with other plants that come into blossom at the same
period.</p>

<p>In the first place, true bulbous plants, like Tulips,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39] </span>
Daffodils, and Bluebells for example, that flower at the
same time may be mixed together for planting in
grassy banks, or near the margins of lakes, &amp;c., where
they are not likely to be disturbed for several years.
Similar combinations may be made with Snowdrops,
Chionodoxas, Scillas, Leucojums, Crocuses, &amp;c., that
appear in the spring; and with Colchicums, autumn-flowering
Crocuses, and Sternbergias in the late
autumn.</p>

<p>In the next place, the grace and beauty of bulbous
plants proper are enhanced by judiciously mixing them
with plants of a non-bulbous nature. Among these
latter may be noted the following as being particularly
useful:&mdash;Wallflowers, Forget-me-Nots, Polyanthuses,
Primroses, White Arabis (<i>A. albida</i>), and Yellow
Alyssum (<i>A. saxatile</i>), Violas and Pansies, the Winter
Aconite (<i>Eranthis hiemalis</i>, and <i>E. cilicica</i>), Silene,
Aubrietia. These are all useful for planting in the
autumn at the same time as the bulbs of Tulips,
Daffodils, Hyacinths, Crocuses, Snowdrops, Scillas,
Chionodoxas, &amp;c. Where formal beds are necessary
the non-bulbous plants may be put in first, leaving
sufficient space between the plants for the insertion of
the bulbs afterwards.</p>

<p>To secure effect and contrast, a little skill, or
rather knowledge, of the different plants used, is<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40] </span>
necessary. Haphazard and careless combinations are
not to be encouraged in the formal flower-beds. It
would be a mistake, for instance, to mix three or four
different kinds of bulbs (<i>e.g.</i>, Snowdrops, Tulips,
Daffodils, or Hyacinths) with Wallflowers, Forget-me-Nots,
or any of the other plants mentioned above.
The effect would be ludicrous, and give the beds a
higgledy-piggledy appearance. Nor would it be wise
to use one kind of plant in such a way that the other
would be smothered or practically concealed from
view. This could happen easily with combinations of
such plants as Wallflowers or Forget-me-Nots, and
such bulbs as Crocuses, Snowdrops, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The true idea of combination should be such that
one plant is really as prominent as the other when in
blossom&mdash;each one, in fact, lending and borrowing at
the same time some charm from the other. Colours
of course play an important part in this scheme, and
care should be exercised at the time of planting <i>not</i>
to combine Yellow Polyanthuses, Yellow Wallflowers,
or Yellow Violas, for instance, with Yellow Tulips or
Daffodils; and so on.</p>

<p>Although it has only been recognised of late years,
owing chiefly to the teachings of Mr. Robinson, there
is no place so natural perhaps for the artistic display
of bulbous plants as in some piece of grass-land,
whether it be a meadow, a sloping bank, the margin<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42] </span>
of a piece of water, or even a lawn. Every lover of
bulbous plants, however, cannot gratify his individual
tastes as to where he would like his bulbs to blossom,
and he must perforce make the best of the piece of
ground&mdash;large or small as it may be&mdash;that happens to
be at his disposal. In large parks and gardens there
is no difficulty, or there ought to be none, in securing
suitable sites to show off the natural graces of the
various bulbous plants recommended for the purpose
in this volume. And even in small suburban gardens,
where one often sees a piece of grass lying bare and
cheerless in winter, a better use might be made of
bulbs. Ce n'est que le premier pas qui coûte. Once
the initial cost and labour of getting the bulbs beneath
the turf is over there is joy ever afterwards, and keen
anticipation in watching the spring and autumn
Crocuses, Sternbergias, Snowdrops, Snowflakes, the
smaller Fritillaries, the Chionodoxas, Scillas, and Bluebells,
Narcissi, Grape Hyacinths, and even Tulips, when
one is not in too great a hurry to get the mowing
done early in the year. One group or another of these
plants (to which may be added the tuberous winter
Aconite, with its glistening yellow blossoms) may be
grown in the smallest of gardens, and will brighten
them year after year without trouble or expense, until,
perhaps, they become so crowded, that lifting and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43] </span>
re-planting becomes essential to prevent suffocation.</p><br>

<p>Early flowering bulbs are capital for planting
beneath deciduous trees on lawns or in large parks and
gardens. The bulbs bloom at a period when the trees
are leafless, and therefore sufficient sunlight is able to
percolate through the bare branches for their benefit.
Such kinds as Snowdrops, Scillas, Chionodoxas, &amp;c.,
are excellent for this purpose, and may be left for
several seasons without disturbance, provided they get
a top-dressing of well-decayed manure during the
autumn. Before the trees expand their leaves, the
bulbous plants beneath have finished their work for
the season, so the absence of light during the summer
does not interfere with them in the least. On the
other hand, however, they enjoy the cool refreshing
shade of the tree foliage, which prevents them from
being shrivelled up.</p><br>



<br>
<h2><a name="BULBOUS_PLANTS_FOR_CUT_FLOWERS" id="BULBOUS_PLANTS_FOR_CUT_FLOWERS"></a><a href="#INDEX">BULBOUS PLANTS FOR CUT FLOWERS.</a></h2>

<p>There are comparatively few of the bulbous plants
mentioned in this volume that are not fit to be cut for
the adornment of bowls, vases, &amp;c., in the dwelling<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44] </span>
house. Some kinds, of course, are much better suited
for the purpose than others, and it would be difficult
indeed to surpass the elegance of the Daffodils,
Tulips, Wood Hyacinths, and Bluebells in the spring
and early summer. Following these we have numerous
Liliums&mdash;white, yellow, orange, red, variously blotched
and speckled, and provided with long wiry stems that
are often a great advantage. The late summer and
autumn flowering kinds are best represented by the
Montbretias, Tritonias, Gladiolus, Brodiæas, and Sparaxis.
The dwarf-flowering bulbous plants, like
Snowdrops, Crocuses, Grape Hyacinths, Chionodoxas,
Colchicums, Sternbergias, Leucojums, &amp;c., although
they look charming in bold masses in the garden,
scarcely afford much length of stalk to enable them to
be used with great effect in bowls, vases, &amp;c., by
themselves. As a groundwork to taller-stemmed
blossoms, however, they are often found to come in
very useful.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to say that the
more simply and naturally flowers are "bunched"
the better they look in room decorations. Very often
indeed, it is difficult to improve on a bunch of flowers
picked at random in the garden and placed in bowls
of water as they are&mdash;with stems of various lengths,</p>

<p>and the blossoms facing in different directions. That<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45] </span>
some people have extraordinary notions as to what a
"bunch" of flowers really means may be gathered
from an inspection of any ordinary local flower show in
the kingdom. At such exhibitions a "bunch" of
flowers is generally as large, flat, unwieldy, and squatty
as possible&mdash;the various kinds being jammed together
as if they were "sticks" of Asparagus done up for
market. Educated judges have been endeavouring
for some years to get an improvement in the method
of putting bunches of flowers together, but with very
little success up to the present. The same old order
of things prevaileth.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="When_to_pick_Flowers" id="When_to_pick_Flowers"></a><a href="#INDEX">When to pick Flowers.</a></b>&mdash;Of course, when people
want flowers they will pick them at any time&mdash;if
they happen to be in their own gardens, not
in other people's. It may be as well, however, to
remind the reader that if picked either early in the
morning&mdash;the earlier the better&mdash;or in the evening
after sunset, flowers last much longer in a cut state,
than if they are picked at any other period of the day.
Perhaps the very worst time to pick flowers is from
mid-day to 2 or 3 o'clock&mdash;especially in summer. The
heat takes a good deal of substance out of the
blossoms, and many get so "blown" that if cut at that
particular period of the day, the petals never recover,
but drop off in a few hours. Tulips are well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a>  </span>
examples of this. In the morning and evening, the
petals close up to a point&mdash;really to prevent the
pollen from getting drenched with dew or rain. But
when the sun shines, they open out, and lie well back
from the stamens so that insects may be lured to take
the pollen from one flower to another. In this state
the blossoms should not be cut or pulled as they will
last but a short time.</p>

<p>The water in which flowers are stood should be
fresh and clean. If some time has elapsed before the
flowers are placed in it, about an inch or so of the
stems may be cut off with a sharp knife, so as to allow
a layer of fresh cells to come in contact with the
water. Some flowers last much longer than others in
a cut state, and the period may be prolonged a little
by putting a pinch of salt, or a little clean charcoal in
the water at the same time.</p><br>

<h2><a name="BULBOUS_PLANTS_FOR_COLD_GREENHOUSES" id="BULBOUS_PLANTS_FOR_COLD_GREENHOUSES"></a><a href="#INDEX">BULBOUS PLANTS FOR COLD GREENHOUSES.</a></h2>

<p>How often one hears complaints as to the lack of
flowers during the coldest months of the year. And
how often one sees, in almost empty greenhouses,
bare shelves that could be made gay with blossom,
and with but little labour or expense. This can be
done easily enough by selecting early flowering bulbs,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47] </span>
and having them "potted up" early in the autumn, so
that they will have made plenty of roots by, say,
Christmas time. The pots most generally useful are
5-inch ones (often called 48's). These should have
some broken pieces put in the bottom for drainage,
and over this a layer of moss or fibre to prevent the
soil from choking it up later on. A compost made up
of three parts of rich fibrous loam, one part of silver or
river sand, and one part of leaf-soil, all well mixed,
should be prepared. A handful or two is placed over
the drainage, and one, two, three, or five bulbs,
according to size, may then be placed on a level
bottom. The pot is then filled to within about a
quarter of an inch of the rim, the soil being firmly
pressed down between the bulbs, the tops of which
may be either level with the surface or beneath it.
In any case, it is not necessary to bury bulbs that are
going to have the protection of a greenhouse so deep
as those planted in the open air, where they will have
no protection from the weather.</p>

<p>The bulbs, having been potted, and labelled if
necessary, say sometime in October or November, need
not be taken into the greenhouse at once. It is better
to keep them in the open air, covered with two or
three inches of fine ashes or coco-nut fibre until the
bulbs have made plenty of new roots in the soil, or<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48] </span>
they may be sheltered in a cold frame. Any time
after this, as many pots as may be required are taken
out of the ashes or fibre, the remains of which should
be washed from the pots and shaken off the surface
of the soil. If there is a slight warmth in the greenhouse,
just enough to keep the frost out on cold nights,
so much the better, but too much heat is unnecessary,
unless one wishes to "force" bulbs into very early
bloom. This, however, generally means exhaustion, if
not death, to the bulbs so artificially treated.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of bulbous plants suitable
for the decoration of cold greenhouses in winter and
early spring in the way indicated, and the following
may be regarded as a good selection:&mdash;Bulbocodiums,
Chionodoxas, Crocuses (Spring), Erythroniums, Fritillarias
(dwarf), Snowdrops, Hyacinths, Snowflakes,
Grape Hyacinths, Dwarf Narcissi, Puschkinias,
Scillas, Sternbergia Fischeriana, Bulbous Irises,
Tecophilæa&mdash;all of which are described in their

<p>When the Zonal Pelargoniums, Marguerites,
Fuchsias, Lobelias, &amp;c., have done their duty in the
window boxes during the summer and autumn months,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49] </span>
it is essential that something else must take their
places for the winter and spring months, unless they
are to be left bare. Dwarf shrubs, of course, like
Aucubas, Golden Privet, Cupressus, Skimmias, &amp;c.,
are much favoured, and rightly so. But in conjunction
with them many kinds of bulbous plants may be
used, and planted at the same time as the shrubs.
Snowdrops and Crocuses are great favourites for the
edges of boxes. Besides these, however, the beautiful
blue-flowered Grape Hyacinths (Muscari), the
Chionodoxas and Scilla sibirica, may be used in a
similar way and with great effect, or as a carpet
beneath the shrubs. If the latter are not placed too
close together, space may be left for a few bulbs of
Tulips and Daffodils to peep out between them.</p>

<p>Of course, window boxes filled entirely with
bulbous plants would probably look much more
artistic than those having a mixture of shrubs and
bulbs. Combinations in miniature could be made
in the same way as suggested for the open air beds
on <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>. Boxes planted with Polyanthuses, Primroses,
Forget-me-Nots, Silene, White Arabis, Yellow
Alyssum, Wallflowers, &amp;c., as well as bulbs, would
not look bare in autumn or winter, and would be very
effective when in blossom in the spring time.</p><br>

<h2><a name="DESCRIPTIONS_CULTURE" id="DESCRIPTIONS_CULTURE"></a>DESCRIPTIONS, CULTURE, PROPAGATION, &amp;c., OF
THE BEST BULBOUS PLANTS FOR THE OPEN AIR.</h2><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 50] </span></p>

<p><b><a name="ALLIUM" id="ALLIUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">ALLIUM.</a></b>&mdash;Although about 250 species of this
liliaceous genus are known, only a dozen or so are
usually met with in gardens&mdash;the limited number
being probably due to the pungent and not altogether
agreeable odour they emit when bruised or cut. In
fact, the plants may be briefly described as more or
less ornamental Onions, as they belong to the same
family as this well-known esculent, and naturally
possess a family likeness. The bulbs are tunicated,
the leaves either flat as in the Leek, or roundish and
hollow as in the ordinary Onion, while the 6-petalled
starry flowers are borne in umbels on the top of the
shoot that springs out of the bulb under the ground.</p>

<p>The kinds mentioned below flourish in ordinary
good garden soil of a gritty nature, that has been
deeply dug and well-manured. They are useful for
the decoration of the flower border in bold patches,
but are probably more natural in grass-land, where
they can remain for several years undisturbed. The
bulbs may be planted in early autumn, 3 or 4 inches
deep&mdash;more or less according to the size of the bulbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a>  </span>
and will come into blossom from April and May, till
July or August. As cut flowers, they are very ornamental,
but unfortunately, they are not greatly used in
this way owing to their odour, which some people find
quite unbearable. Propagation is effected by means
of offsets from the bulbs, or seeds. Two species&mdash;<i>A.
Moly</i>, and <i>A. neapolitanum</i>&mdash;are often forced into early
blossoms in the greenhouse, in the way mentioned at
<a href="#Page_46">p. 46.</a></p>

<p>The following are the best kinds:&mdash;<i>Neapolitanum</i>,
<i>Erdeli</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_18">Plate 18</a>, fig. 72), <i>karataviense</i>, <i>triquetrum</i>,
<i>ursinum</i>, and <i>zebdanense</i>, all with white or whitish
flowers; <i>acuminatum</i>, <i>hirtiflorum</i>, <i>Macnabianum</i>,
<i>narcissiflorum</i> (or <i>pedemontanum</i>), <i>Ostrowskianum</i>,
<i>Schuberti</i>, and <i>Suworowi</i>, representing rose, magenta,
crimson, lilac, and purple shades; the best yellow-flowered
kinds are, <i>Moly</i> (<a href="#PLATE_17">Plate 17</a>, fig. 68), <i>flavum</i>,
and <i>orientale</i>; while <i>coeruleum</i> (or <i>azureum</i>) is the most
attractive species with blue flowers. <i>A. acuminatum</i>
is the dwarfest of these, being only about a foot high,
the others rarely exceeding 1-1/2 to 2 feet, except perhaps
<i>hirtiflorum</i> and <i>Suworowi</i>, which often are 3 feet high.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="AMARYLLIS" id="AMARYLLIS"></a><a href="#INDEX">AMARYLLIS</a> Belladonna</b> (<i><a name="Belladonna_Lily" id="Belladonna_Lily"></a>Belladonna Lily</i>).&mdash;This
charming member of the Narcissus family deserves
more extensive cultivation than it enjoys at present.
It is a native of South Africa, and has large bulbs&mdash;3<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52] </span>
to 4 inches or more deep&mdash;with thickish, silky-woollen
coats, and strap-shaped leaves, usually 12 to 18 inches
long. About August and September, the sweet-scented
funnel-shaped blossoms of a soft rosy colour (see <a href="#PLATE_31">Plate
31</a>, fig. 111) are produced on top of a stout stalk, 12 to
18 inches high, after the foliage has withered. Some
varieties are better than others, but the best of all is
that which originated at Kew, and is remarkable for
having three or four dozen rich rosy crimson flowers
on a scape 2 to 3 feet high.</p>

<p>The Belladonna Lily can only be grown satisfactorily
in the open air in the milder parts of the
kingdom. The bulbs should be planted about
9 inches deep in a well-drained loamy soil containing
plenty of sand and leaf-soil. Beneath a wall facing
due south is generally a good position for the plants.
In winter, cold rains should be kept off by placing a
layer of leaves or litter over the dormant bulbs. The
simplest way to increase the stock is to detach the
offsets from the old bulbs whenever the latter are
disturbed&mdash;say every fourth or fifth year.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The gorgeous plants grown in greenhouses
under the name of Amaryllis rightly belong to the
genus Hippeastrum, and are too tender for open air
culture in our climate.</p>

leaves, and the bright-coloured tubular flowers of
these plants very much resemble those of the closely-related
genus Gladiolus. Indeed, what suits the
Gladiolus will suit the Antholyzas in the way of a
well-drained loamy soil. A somewhat warmer and
sunnier position is, however, necessary, as these South
African plants have not been acclimatised by selection
and hybridisation in the same way as the Gladiolus.
The best-known kinds are <i>æthiopica</i>, with spikes of
scarlet and greenish flowers; <i>caffra</i>, rich scarlet;
<i>Cunonia</i>, scarlet and black; <i>fulgens</i>, rich coppery rose;
and <i>paniculata</i>, with red, brown, and yellow blossoms,

<p><b><a name="BABIANA" id="BABIANA"></a><a href="#INDEX">BABIANA</a></b> (<i><a name="Baboon_Root" id="Baboon_Root"></a>Baboon Root</i>).&mdash;Charming plants of the
Iris family, with fibrous-coated corms about an inch in
diameter, stiffish, hairy, plaited leaves, and dense
spikes of funnel-shaped flowers. The latter, in most
cases, are sweetly scented and brilliantly coloured, and
in a cut state, are exceedingly handsome for decorative
work. Unfortunately the plants are not very hardy,
and can only be grown in the open air in the very
warmest and mildest parts of the kingdom with anything
like success. In favourable localities the corms
should be planted 3 or 4 inches deep, in mild weather,
any time between September and November. The<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54] </span>
soil should be very light, loamy, and well-drained, and
the position should be the warmest and sunniest in the
garden. Plenty of sand or grit around the corms is
an advantage, and a covering of leaves or litter will
keep off cold winter rains. Babianas are very useful
for cool greenhouse decoration, and may be easily
grown in pots, only giving water when roots have
developed, and the new leaves are beginning to show.
(See <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>).</p>

<p>The best kinds are <i>disticha</i>, pale blue; <i>plicata</i>,
violet blue; <i>ringens</i>, scarlet; <i>stricta</i>, the three outer
segments of which are white, the three inner lilac-blue
with a dark blotch at the base. This is the best-known
kind, and there are many forms of it, notably
<i>angustifolia</i>, bright blue tinged with pink; and
<i>rubro-cyanea</i>, brilliant blue and crimson. All increased
by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="BESSERA" id="BESSERA"></a><a href="#INDEX">BESSERA</a> elegans.</b>&mdash;A pretty liliaceous plant, 1-1/2 to
2 feet high, with slender rush-like leaves, and scarlet
or scarlet and white bell-shaped blossoms. Being a
native of Mexico it is rather tender, and can only be
grown out of doors in the mildest parts of the British
Isles in the same way as the Babianas. As a pot
plant it may be grown in a cool greenhouse. Increased
by offsets from the brown silky-coated corms.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="BLOOMERIA" id="BLOOMERIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">BLOOMERIA</a> aurea.</b>&mdash;This is the best known<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55] </span>
species. It is a native of California and belongs to
the Lily family. The small corms are covered with
netted pale brown coats, from which spring long
narrow leaves, and umbels of bright yellow starry
flowers about June or July. <i>B. Clevelandi</i> is another
species with smaller yellow flowers. The corms of
both kinds should be planted in warm sunny spots in
well-drained sandy loam and leaf-soil in the autumn,
and a little protection with leaves or litter may be
given in cold wet winters.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="BOBARTIA" id="BOBARTIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">BOBARTIA</a> aurantiaca.</b>&mdash;This pretty member of
the Iris family is also known under the name of
<i>Homeria</i>. It has roundish corms, an inch or more in
diameter, covered with pale brown shaggy fibrous
coats. The orange-red or yellow blossoms appear in
summer and last a long time. The plant is a native
of South Africa, and can only be grown in the mildest
parts of the kingdom in the same way as the
Babianas, Ixias, &amp;c., which see. Increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="BRAVOA" id="BRAVOA"></a><a href="#INDEX">BRAVOA</a> geminiflora.</b>&mdash;A graceful Mexican plant
of the Narcissus family, with roundish fibrous-coated
corms over an inch in diameter, and narrow sword-like
leaves 12 to 18 inches long. The bright red or
scarlet tubular blossoms droop in pairs from stalks
1 to 2 feet high from July onwards. In the milder
parts of the kingdom this plant may be grown easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a>  </span>
in sheltered sunny spots in rich sandy loam and leaf-soil,
protection being only needed in severe winters

seeds sown in spring.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="BREVOORTIA" id="BREVOORTIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">BREVOORTIA</a> Ida-Maia</b> (<i>Brodiæa coccinea</i>).&mdash;This
beautiful Liliaceous plant is popularly known as
the "Californian Fire Cracker." It has roundish
corms an inch or so in diameter, with brown fibrous
coats. The leaves are very narrow, while the tubular
flowers are borne in loose umbels in June or July on
top of slender wiry stalks 2 to 3 feet high. The
shape and colour of the individual blossoms are shown
on <a href="#PLATE_19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 75. They are very attractive in bold
masses, and are excellent for cutting purposes. In
the garden it is essential to support the slender
flower-stems with thin sticks to keep the blossoms
from trailing in the dirt. During September and
October is the best time to plant the corms 3 to 4
inches deep, in rich sandy loam, in warm sunny spots
in the border or rock-garden, where they should be
allowed to remain for three or four seasons before they
need be disturbed. Increased by offsets and seeds.</p>

have practically the same characters as those of
Brevoortia, the chief differences being that many (but<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57] </span>
not all) of the Brodiæas have six fertile stamens instead
of three, and the perianth in many cases is more funnel
or bell-shaped than cylindrical. The corms are about
the same size with netted, brown, silky coats, but are
quite distinct from those in the section formerly
known under the names of <i>Milla</i> and <i>Triteleia</i>. The
cultural treatment is precisely the same as detailed

<p><b><a name="BULBOCODIUM" id="BULBOCODIUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">BULBOCODIUM</a> vernum.</b>&mdash;A charming Crocus-like
plant of the Lily family, closely related to the Meadow
Saffrons (Colchicum), as may be seen by comparing
the method of lateral growth of the brown-coated
corms&mdash;each an inch or more in diameter. It is a
native of the Alps. In mild seasons it often produces
its violet or rosy-purple funnel-shaped flowers in
January, not more than 6 inches from the ground,
and remains in blossom in company with Snowdrops,
Leucojums, &amp;c. The leaves appear afterwards and
elaborate food for the production of next year's corms
before they wither. A rich well-drained loam with a
little sand and leaf-soil suits it very well, and the
corms may be planted in September or October about
4 inches deep, in bold masses in the rock garden or
grass-land, and left alone for a few years, after which
there will be numerous offsets to increase the stock.
As slugs are very fond of the young growths, they
must be carefully looked for morning and evening,
and a little soot or lime carefully spread round the
plants may help to check them (see <a href="#Page_142">p. 142</a>).</p><br>

<p><b><a name="CALOCHORTUS" id="CALOCHORTUS"></a><a href="#INDEX">CALOCHORTUS</a></b> (<i>Mariposa Lily</i>).&mdash;A very distinct
group of Liliaceous plants with brown-coated bulbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a>  </span>
narrow leaves, and very showy and distinct-looking
blossoms&mdash;some of which are shown in <a href="#PLATE_22">Plate 22</a>,
fig. 84, and also in <a href="#PLATE_20">Plate 20</a> of the companion volume
"<span class="smcap">Beautiful Garden Flowers</span>." Joined to the Mariposa
Lilies proper are the "<a href="#INDEX">Star Tulips,</a>" formerly known
under the name of <i><a href="#INDEX">Cyclobothra</a></i>&mdash;well-known representatives
of which are shown in the same Plate, figs.
85 and 86. They are quite distinct in the appearance
of the flowers, but botanically they are considered to
be identical in the important characters. Both groups
are well worth growing in the milder parts of the
kingdom in warm sunny parts of the garden. This is
essential as most of them are natives of California,
Oregon, Arizona, and parts of Mexico, where they
have plenty of sunshine and are not subject to the
cold drenching rains that often characterise the
British winter. In colder districts where they would
be unable to survive the ordinary winter, the plants
may be brought to perfection in a cold frame so long
as they are free from frost and heavy rains. The
soil in which they appear to flourish best seems to be
sharp sand, leaf-soil and road grit, well mixed together
with a little loam added. The bed&mdash;in which the
bulbs are to be planted 3 to 4 inches deep, from
September to November, but not later&mdash;should be
raised above the general level, the better to throw the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60] </span>
water off in winter. If the beds or borders are facing
south and slightly sloping, so much the better. A
light covering with reeds or bracken is advisable
during severe weather, but should be removed on all
warm days, and altogether from February and March,
as the young growths will then begin to push through
the soil. After the flowering period&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, July and
August&mdash;is over, and the foliage has withered, the
bulbs may be either lifted and carefully stored in sand
or dry earth until the planting season comes round
again; or, better still, lights may be placed over them
to keep the bulbs dry and allow them to ripen
thoroughly and naturally. If the latter treatment is
adopted the bulbs need not be disturbed for three or
four years, and will give better blossom on the whole
in consequence. It must be remembered that although
the bulbs dislike moisture when dormant, they must
have a sufficient supply during active growth, otherwise
they may soon become parched and withered.
The easiest way to increase the plants is by means of
offsets. When seeds ripen they may be sown very
thinly in pots or pans in spring, and the seedlings may
remain for a couple of seasons before being transplanted.
Sometimes "bulbils" (see <a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>) are
produced on the stems, and may be sown in light
sandy soil as if they were seeds. From seeds and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61] </span>
bulbils it takes from three to six years to produce a
flowering bulb.</p>

<p>There are now several kinds of Mariposa Lily in
cultivation. Of these the varieties of the <i>venustus</i>
group are undoubtedly the handsomest. (See <a href="#PLATE_22">Plate 22</a>,
fig. 84.) They grow about 18 inches high, and have
cup-shaped flowers 3 inches across, having three very
large and three very small segments. The colour of the
type is white, yellow at the base, deeply stained with
crimson, and having a conspicuous blotch at the base.
In the variety <i>alba</i> the flowers are wholly white;
<i>lilacinus</i>, deep lilac; <i>purpurascens</i>, lilac-purple; <i>citrinus</i>,
lemon-yellow; <i>oculatus</i>, with rosy buds passing into
white, with a deep blackish-purple blotch in the centre
of a yellow base; and <i>Vesta</i>, flowers very large, white
flushed with rose, and marked with brown and yellow
at the base.</p>

<p>Other kinds are <i>albus</i>, with drooping pearly-white
flowers (<a href="#PLATE_22">Plate 22</a>, fig. 85); <i>apiculatus</i>, lemon-yellow;
<i>Benthami</i>, bright yellow; <i>coeruleus</i>, lilac or creamy-white,
densely bearded with blue hairs; <i>clavatus</i>, golden-yellow;
<i>elegans</i>, white tinged with purple, but rich
pink in the variety <i>amoenus</i>; <i>flavus</i>, yellow, drooping;
<i>Goldyi</i>, old gold with hairy centre; <i>Howelli</i>, creamy-white;
<i>Kennedyi</i>, orange-red; <i>lilacinus</i>, pink, purple,
or lilac, a fine species; <i>luteus</i>, yellow or orange, with<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62] </span>
purple hairs; <i>Plummeræ</i>, large soft lilac flowers, with
golden-yellow hairs and blotched with purple;
<i>pulchellus</i>, orange-yellow, sweet-scented, drooping
(see <a href="#PLATE_22">Plate 22</a>, fig. 86); <i>Purdyi</i>, white, spotted
with purple, and covered with long white hairs;
<i>splendens</i> pale lilac, with silky white hairs and deep

<p><b><a name="CAMASSIA" id="CAMASSIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">CAMASSIA.</a></b>&mdash;Graceful-looking North American
plants of the Lily family, with rather large ovoid
bulbs, strap-shaped tapering leaves, and loose racemes
of starry blossoms which usually appear from May to
July, and are useful for decorations when cut. They
flourish in ordinary good and well-drained garden soil
in warm sheltered spots. The bulbs should be planted
in September or October, and covered with about
twice their own depth of soil. They may be left undisturbed
for a few seasons, but in that case a
mulching of well-decayed manure in autumn would be
beneficial. New plants are most readily secured by
offsets from the old bulbs. Seeds, however, are
freely produced in most places and should be sown in
cold frames as soon as ripe. (See <a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>).</p>

2 inches across, are borne on scapes 1-1/2 to 3 feet high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a>  </span>
and look very handsome above the narrow arching
leaves. <i>C. Cusicksi</i>, with porcelain-blue flowers (see

<p><b><a name="CHIONODOXA" id="CHIONODOXA"></a><a href="#INDEX">CHIONODOXA</a> Luciliæ</b> (<i>Glory of the Snow</i>).&mdash;This
charming harbinger of spring is a native of Asia Minor,
where it pushes its beautiful brilliant blue and white
blossoms (see <a href="#PLATE_2">Plate 2</a>, fig. 9) through the snow-clad
mountains early in the year. It has ovoid bulbs about
1 to 2 inches deep, arching leaves, and each flower-stalk
6 to 10 inches high, carries from six to twenty
blossoms in February, March, and April. There are
several fine varieties, the best being <i>gigantea</i> (or
<i>grandiflora</i>), with very large flowers; <i>sardensis</i>, shown
on <a href="#PLATE_13">Plate 13</a>, fig. 53, has gentian-blue flowers. The
variety <i>alba</i> has pure-white flowers, and <i>Tmolusi</i> and
<i>Alleni</i> are also good varieties. A hybrid between
<i>C. Luciliæ</i> and <i>Scilla bifolia</i> is known as <i><a name="Chiono-scilla" id="Chiono-scilla"></a><a href="#INDEX">Chiono-scilla</a></i>,
but is not common. Other Chionodoxas are <i>C. cretica</i>,
with white or pale-blue flowers very scantily produced;
and <i>C. nana</i>, with white or lilac-tinted flowers.</p>

<p>Chionodoxas flourish in ordinary good garden soil,
and are suitable for the rockery, flower-border,
beneath deciduous trees in shrubberies, or in the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64] </span>
grass. To be effective in any of these positions they
should be planted in hundreds and thousands, and in
grass-land may be mixed with the smaller-flowered
kinds of Narcissus (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>minimus</i>, <i>cyclamineus</i>, <i>triandrus</i>).
In the latter case the bulbs may be left
alone for years with advantage, as they never interfere
with mowing operations.</p>

<p>Offsets are freely produced from the old bulbs,
and are the easiest means of increasing the stock.
Seeds may be sown when ripe, but they take a few
years to produce flowering bulbs (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>).</p><br>

<p><b><a name="CHLOROGALUM" id="CHLOROGALUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">CHLOROGALUM</a> pomeridianum</b> (<i>Soap Plant</i>).&mdash;A

leaves and spikes of whitish purple-veined
flowers, that usually open in the afternoon during the
summer months. It flourishes in ordinary soil, and

best time to plant is in autumn.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="COLCHICUM" id="COLCHICUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">COLCHICUM</a></b> (<i>Meadow Saffron</i>).&mdash;In the autumn,
when the landscape looks more or less dreary, the
Colchicums relieve the monotony with their bright
appearance. The bulbs are peculiarly one-sided, and
differ a good deal in size according to the species, so
that they should be planted at various depths according
to size. The best time for planting is July, or not
later than August, and if massed in bold patches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a>  </span>
the grass, flower-border, shrubbery, or rock-garden,
the effect later on will be much more effective than if
the bulbs were put in sparingly. A rich sandy loam
will suit most kinds, but any good and well-drained
garden soil will give satisfactory results. It may be
remarked that most kinds produce their flowers without
the leaves. The latter appear the following spring
to elaborate food for the new bulbs, dying down
during the summer. Colchicums are best propagated
by offsets. Seeds may also be sown about midsummer
when thoroughly ripe, and will produce flowering
bulbs in five or six years (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>). There are
many kinds, the most popular being: <i>C. autumnale</i>,
a British plant, popularly known as the "Autumn
Crocus"&mdash;owing to the shape and bright purple
colour of its cup-shaped blossoms, which appear from
the end of August to November. There are many
varieties of it such as <i>album</i>, white; with a double
form; <i>maximum</i>, purple; <i>purpureum</i>, purple rose;
and <i>striatum</i>, red striped with white. <i>C. Bivonæ</i> has
flowers chequered with white and purple. <i>C. Bornmülleri</i>,
a fine species with rosy-lilac flowers.
<i>C. byzantinum</i> has pale rose blossoms. <i>C. giganteum</i>,
flowers rosy, very large. <i>C. libanoticum</i>, white.
<i>C. montanum</i> produces its lilac-purple or whitish
flowers in February and March. <i>C. Parkinsoni</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66] </span>
has white flowers distinctly veined and chequered
with violet-purple. The flowers of <i>C. speciosum</i>,
shown in <a href="#PLATE_33">Plate 33</a>, fig. 118, appear in September and
October, and vary from reddish or rose-purple to deep
crimson-purple. <i>C. variegatum</i> (a very old species
also called <i>Parkinsoni</i>) has its rosy flowers beautifully
chequered with violet purple.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="CRINUM" id="CRINUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">CRINUM.</a></b>&mdash;Most of the Crinums require the protection
of a greenhouse or hothouse in our climate.
The kinds mentioned below, however, may be grown
in the open air in the milder parts of the country.
The large and broad strap-shaped leaves, 2 to 4 feet
long, more or less gracefully recurving from the long-necked
bulbs, are in themselves a noble sight, but
their beauty is considerably enhanced when the large,
funnel-shaped blossoms are borne in clusters on the
top of a stout, fleshy stalk. Given a rich and well-drained,
loamy soil, warm-sheltered spots, and sufficient
moisture during active growth, and the hardy Crinums
usually flourish. They may be increased by offsets
taken from the base of the large old bulbs; or by
means of the large fleshy bulb-like seeds that are
produced in favourable seasons. The seed needs only
to be placed on the top of moist soil in a pot, and
under the shelter of a greenhouse or cold frame will
soon germinate in its own peculiar way. The best-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a>  </span>
hardy Crinums are <i>C. Moorei</i>, a native of South
Africa. It has large long-necked bulbs, broad bright-green
leaves 2 to 3 feet long, and clusters of soft-pink
flowers, each 6 inches or more across, on a scape 2 to
3 feet high (see <a href="#PLATE_30">Plate 30</a>, fig. 109). <i>C. Powelli</i>, with
a reddish wash down the centre of the petals, and its
pure white variety <i>album</i> (<a href="#PLATE_32">Plate 32</a>, fig. 115) are also
two very fine plants for the out-door garden. They are
really forms, or hybrids perhaps, of the South African
<i>S. longifolium</i> (or <i>C. capense</i>), which has large white
flowers with a central reddish stain on the outside of
the petals. It is quite as hardy as the other kinds
and may be treated in the same way.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="CROCOSMA" id="CROCOSMA"></a><a href="#INDEX">CROCOSMA</a> aurea.</b>&mdash;This beautiful Iridaceous
plant is perhaps better known as <i>Tritonia aurea</i>. It
is a native of South Africa, and has fibrous-coated
corms, narrow sword-shaped leaves, and brilliant
orange-red starry blossoms borne on branched stems
about 2 feet high, in August or September. It likes
a rich sandy loam and leaf-soil and soon makes fine
clumps in the milder parts of the kingdom. In cold
districts and the north generally, the corms may be
lifted in October or November, when the leaves have
withered, and may be stored in sand or soil until
spring. Then they may be replanted, any offsets
from the older corms being placed in separate beds<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68] </span>
and grown on until large enough for flowering. As
a pot plant for greenhouse decoration, the Crocosma
is most useful. After potting in spring, the pots
may be plunged (<i>i.e.</i>, sunk up to the rims) in ashes or
fibre, and plenty of water should be given during the
summer months when the growth is active. When
the flower-spikes appear the plants may be taken into
the greenhouse or conservatory.</p>

<p><b><a name="CROCUS" id="CROCUS"></a><a href="#INDEX">CROCUS.</a></b>&mdash;The popularity of the Crocus is undoubted,
but popular favour generally confines itself
to the white, blue, lilac, purple, yellow, and striped
varieties of <i>C. aureus</i>, the Old Dutch yellow Crocus,
and <i>C. vernus</i>. These all flower from February to
April, and when planted in hundreds and thousands
in the borders or grass-land they are then indeed a
glorious sight, especially if naturalised with Snowdrops,
Leucojums, and Bulbocodiums. The individual
blossoms do not last long, but they are thrown up so
profusely from the roundish corms beneath, that they
give a continuous glow for several weeks in early
spring. The above all flourish in light sandy loam
and leaf-soil. To secure the best results the corms
should be planted about 3 inches deep in September or
October. When possible, as in grass-land for example,
the plants should not be disturbed for a few seasons,
so they may increase as Nature intended. In this way<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69] </span>
they will produce a more striking picture each succeeding
year, especially if they have had the advantage
of a top-dressing with well-decayed manure in
autumn. When the corms have to be lifted each year
to make way in the borders for summer-flowering
plants, the best time to take them up is when the
foliage has begun to wither. This process is often
hastened by twisting the narrow leaves and tying
them into little bundles.</p>

<p>Apart from the ordinary spring-flowering Crocuses,
<i>aureus</i> and <i>vernus</i> (a selection of which can be obtained
from any bulb catalogue), there are several natural
species which also flower in spring, and may be planted
and grown exactly in the same way. Amongst these
the best known are <i>alatavicus</i>, white and yellow;
<i>Balansæ</i>, orange-yellow; <i>banaticus</i>, bright purple and
white; <i>biflorus</i>, white to pale lavender, known as the
"<a name="Cloth_of_Silver" id="Cloth_of_Silver"></a>Cloth of Silver Crocus," of which there are many
beautiful forms; <i>Biliotti</i>, purple; <i>carpetanus</i>, lilac to
white; <i>chrysanthus</i>, orange-yellow, with several varieties;
<i>dalmaticus</i>, lilac and yellow; <i>etruscus</i>, purple and
yellow, striped; <i>Fleischeri</i>, white and yellow, veined
purple; <i>Imperati</i>, lilac-purple, with deeper stripes;
<i>Korolkowi</i>, yellow; <i>reticulatus</i> or <i>variegatus</i>, white to
deep lilac, veined purple; <i>stellaris</i>, orange; <i>suaveolens</i>,
lilac and yellow, veined purple; <i>Susianus</i> or <i>revolutus</i>,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70] </span>
deep orange, known as the "Cloth of Gold Crocus";
<i>versicolor</i>, purple to white, veined purple; and <i>vitellinus</i>,
orange.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Autumn-Flowering_Crocuses" id="Autumn-Flowering_Crocuses"></a><a href="#INDEX">Autumn-Flowering Crocuses.</a></b>&mdash;Colchicums, and
especially <i>C. autumnale</i>, are popularly known as
"Autumn Crocuses." They belong, however, to the
Lily family, and must not be confused with those
species of Crocus proper which belong to the Iris
family, and also flower during the autumn months,
sometimes even as late as December, when the blossoms
are often spoiled by the weather, unless protected with
handlights or frames. At this period they are very
useful, with the Colchicums and Sternbergias, for the
decoration of grassy slopes and banks, and may be
intermingled with them in places where they can
remain undisturbed for some years.</p>

<p>The chief difference in the cultivation of Spring
and Autumn Crocuses, is that the corms of the latter
should be planted in July, or not later than August&mdash;in
fact, at the same time as the Colchicums. The
following are among the best Autumn Crocuses:&mdash;<i>Asturicus</i>,
violet, purple; <i>Boryi</i>, white and yellow;
<i>cancellatus</i>, white to purple, and lilac; <i>caspius</i>, white
tinted rose; <i>Clusi</i>, pale purple and white; <i>hadriaticus</i>,
white and purple; <i>iridiflorus</i> or <i>byzantinus</i>, purple,
lilac; <i>Karduchorum</i>, lilac, veined with purple; <i>longiflorus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a>  </span>
lilac, yellow, sweet-scented; <i>medius</i>, purple,
veined, see <a href="#PLATE_33">Plate 33</a>, fig. 117; <i>ochroleucus</i>, creamy-white,
orange, see <a href="#PLATE_33">Plate 33</a>, fig. 121; <i>pulchellus</i>,
lavender-blue and yellow, veined; <i>Salzmanni</i>, lilac
to white, veined; <i>sativus</i>, lilac, veined purple; the
well-known "Saffron Crocus" of commerce, with
several varieties; <i>Scharojani</i>, orange-yellow; <i>speciosus</i>,
lilac, purple, with deeper veins, see <a href="#PLATE_33">Plate 33</a>, fig. 122;
and <i>zonatus</i>, rosy-lilac, veined purple.</p>

<p>All Crocuses may be easily increased by offsets,
which may be detached when the corms are lifted.
Seeds take about three years to produce flowering
corms (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>).</p><br>

<p><b><a name="DIERAMA" id="DIERAMA"></a><a href="#INDEX">DIERAMA</a></b> (<b>Sparaxis</b>) <b>pulcherrima.</b>&mdash;This is a charming
South African plant with fibrous-coated corms,
and long narrow sword-like leaves. It has beautiful
funnel-shaped flowers, which droop from thread-like
stalks about September and October, a period when
they are sometimes injured by the bad weather. The
blossoms, which are shown on <a href="#PLATE_31">Plate 31</a>, fig. 112, are
usually crimson in colour, but there also exist white,
pale-red, and prettily-striped forms, all borne on
stalks 3 to 6 feet high, and beautiful for cutting
purposes. <i>D. pendula</i>, with deeply veined lilac flowers,
is another species not so well known.</p>

<p>
The plants cannot be considered hardy, except in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72] </span>
the milder parts of the kingdom. In less favoured
spots they may be planted in spring in warm sunny
spots sheltered from cold winds, and if left in the
ground in winter should be protected from cold rains
and frosts with litter, bracken, lights, &amp;c. A light
sandy loam, with a little leaf-soil, will suit the plants
best, and they may be increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="ERYTHRONIUM" id="ERYTHRONIUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">ERYTHRONIUM</a></b> (<i>Dog's Tooth Violet</i>).&mdash;These
pretty plants of the Lily order have more or less
oblong or cylindrical bulbs, sometimes with creeping
rhizomes, and leaves more or less marbled or blotched
or sometimes green. The 6-petalled blossoms are,
more or less, drooping, but are usually conspicuous
above the foliage and render the plants very attractive
either in the rock-garden, flower-border, or grass-land.
The plants like a moist sandy loam and leaf-soil, which,
however, must be well drained so that the bulbs may
not decay with the winter rains. Offsets are the
easiest means of increasing the stock, and are best
taken off after the flowers are over and the leaves
have withered, <i>i.e.</i>, about midsummer.</p>

<p>The Common Dog's Tooth Violet (<i>E. Dens-Canis</i>)
is an old-world plant, and has been in cultivation many years. It has blue-green leaves, marbled with
dull purple, and the flowers are of a soft rose or
purple hue, although there are various shades (as<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73] </span>
shown on <a href="#PLATE_13">Plate 13</a>, fig. 54), including a white one.
There are now many other species and varieties
in cultivation&mdash;all natives of temperate North
America, and well worthy of a place in the garden.
They all blossom from March to May, and vary
in height from 3 to 12 inches. The following are
the best known at present:&mdash;<i>Albidum</i>, white, tinged
yellow, or wholly yellow in the variety <i>bracteatum</i>;
<i>americanum</i>, golden yellow, tinged purple; <i>citrinum</i>,
lemon yellow; <i>Dens-Canis</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_13">Plate 13</a>, figs. 54 and
55); <i>giganteum</i>, white, suffused with orange or yellow;
<i>grandiflorum</i>, yellow; <i>Hartwegi</i>, creamy-white and
orange; <i>Hendersoni</i>, rose to purple with yellow
centre; <i>Howelli</i>, yellow and orange; <i>Johnstoni</i>, rosy-pink
(see <a href="#PLATE_12">Plate 12</a>, fig. 94); <i>montanum</i>, creamy-white;
<i>propullans</i>, rose-purple; <i>purpurascens</i>, pale yellow
tinged purple, or lilac in the variety <i>grandiflorum</i>;
this species has sometimes about a dozen flowers on a
scape; and <i>revolutum</i>, pink to rosy-purple, or white
with a yellow centre in the variety <i>Bolanderi</i> or <i>Smithi</i>.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="EUCOMIS" id="EUCOMIS"></a><a href="#INDEX">EUCOMIS</a> punctata.</b>&mdash;This bold-looking plant is
probably the best and most ornamental member of the
genus. It has very large bulbs and tufts of gracefully
spreading and recurved wavy leaves, bright shining
green above, and densely spotted with purple beneath.
The creamy-white or yellowish starry blossoms, with a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74] </span>
conspicuous violet ovary in the centre, appear from
July to September, and are packed close together on
a stout purple spotted scape 1-1/2 to 2 feet high. Other
species are <i>bicolor</i>, with unspotted leaves and greenish-yellow
flowers; <i>nana</i>, which grows only about 9 inches
high, has brownish-green blossoms; <i>undulata</i>, greenish-yellow
ones; <i>regia</i>, white; and <i>pallidiflora</i>, with leaves
over 2 feet long, and 4 inches or more broad, has
greenish-white flowers.</p>

<p>They are all natives of South Africa, and may be
grown in warm sheltered spots in the milder parts of
the country. They like a rich and well-drained sandy
loam, and if left undisturbed for a few years, will
probably require protection in bleak localities from
winter rains and frost. They may be increased by
offsets. It takes four or five years to secure flowering
bulbs from seeds.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="FERRARIA" id="FERRARIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">FERRARIA</a> undulata.</b>&mdash;A distinct looking Iridaceous
plant with tunicated bulbs, sword-like wavy leaves, and
peculiar dull-purple flowers, each with six wavy
segments spotted with purple, and appearing in
March and April. This plant flourishes in well-drained
sandy loam and leaf-soil, and may be considered
fairly hardy in the milder parts of the kingdom.
Increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="FRITILLARIA" id="FRITILLARIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">FRITILLARIA</a>.</b>&mdash;There are fifty species or more<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75] </span>
belonging to this genus, but many of them, although
highly interesting, are so dull in colour or small in
blossom, that they are only likely to be met with in
botanical collections. The common Crown Imperial
(<i>F. imperialis</i>), shown in Plate 16, figs. 65 and 66, with
its sturdy stems, 2 to 3 feet high, bright green wavy
leaves, and bright yellow drooping blossoms, is
probably the best known; but there are many forms
of it in which the flowers vary in colour from yellow
to orange and bright red. The Snake's Head
(<i>F. Meleagris</i>) is another well-known species to be
seen growing naturally in moist meadows in parts of
England. Its beautiful white, rosy or purple blossoms
(see <a href="#PLATE_8">Plate 8</a>, fig. 33) droop from the stalks, 1 to
1-1/2 feet high in April and May, and are beautifully
chequered with deeper coloured bands. For
naturalising in the grass with Narcissi, Dog's Tooth
Violets, &amp;c., this is a very valuable plant. <i>F. Moggridgei</i>,
a dwarf form of the purple, brown, and yellow
<i>delphinensis</i>, is another good garden plant shown on
<a href="#PLATE_8">Plate 8</a>, fig. 31. The following kinds may be used
for naturalising in the grass or for grouping in
nooks of the rock-garden:&mdash;<i>Fusco-lutea</i>, <i>aurea</i>, <i>citrina</i>,
<i>lusitanica</i>, <i>lutea</i>, <i>askabadensis</i> (finely figured in
"<span class="smcap">Flora and Sylva</span>,") <i>discolor</i>, <i>pallidiflora</i>, <i>pudica</i>,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76] </span>
<i>Thunbergi</i>, <i>Whittalli</i>, all with yellow or greenish-yellow
blossoms, and ranging from 6 to 12 inches high. To
these may be added <i>F. recurva</i> (<a href="#PLATE_8">Plate 8</a>, fig. 34), a
Californian species, about 1 foot high, and remarkable
for its drooping bright orange-scarlet blossoms, the
interior of which is yellow blotched with purple.
<i>F. camtschatcensis</i>, the "Black Lily," has deep
blackish-red flowers. It flourishes in moist sandy
loam and peat.</p>

<p><i>F. Walujewi</i>, with narrow tendril-tipped leaves, has
silver-grey flowers suffused with purple brown, and
spotted with red and white within (see <a href="#PLATE_8">Plate 8</a>, fig. 32).
To these may be added <i>armena</i>, dark purple; <i>Elwesi</i>,
green and purple; <i>pyrenaica</i>, green and purple,
spotted; <i>persica</i> or <i>libanotica</i>, chocolate, purple and
green; <i>latifolia</i>, purple, lilac, yellow, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Fritillarias have bulbs of various sizes, and
many of them&mdash;notably those of <i>F. imperialis</i>&mdash;emit a
very strong and disagreeable odour. They produce
offsets freely in most cases, and in this way the stock
may be increased. The best time for lifting and transplanting
the bulbs is after the foliage has withered.</p>

<p><b><a name="GAGEA" id="GAGEA"></a><a href="#INDEX">GAGEA</a> lutea.</b>&mdash;This British plant, with small
roundish bulbs, and long narrow leaves, is called the
"Yellow Star of Bethlehem" on account of its yellow
starry flowers, with a green central line, appearing
from March to May on stalks about 6 inches high. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a>  </span>
grows in ordinary garden soil and may be increased
by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="GALANTHUS" id="GALANTHUS"></a><a href="#INDEX">GALANTHUS</a></b> (<i>Snowdrop</i>).&mdash;The common British
Snowdrop (<i>G. nivalis</i>) is an old time garden favourite,
not only on account of the purity of its blossoms&mdash;almost
rivalling the whiteness of the snow&mdash;but because
they appear during the very dullest months of the year,
often before Christmas, and lasting till the Crocuses,
early Narcissi, Chionodoxas, Bulbocodiums, Leucojums,
&amp;c., come to keep them company. A few
blooms are shown on <a href="#PLATE_2">Plate 2</a>, fig. 8, not because it
was necessary to tell the reader what a Snowdrop was
like, but to record the general appearance of other
Snowdrops that are now to be met with in cultivation.
The most important of these are <i>Elwesi</i>, with its
varieties <i>globosus</i> and <i>robustus</i>, all of which have
large flowers; <i>Fosteri</i> has been called the "King of
Snowdrops" on account of its fine leaves and flowers.
Other fine kinds are <i>Imperati</i>, <i>latifolius</i>, and <i>plicatus</i>,
the last named recognised by its long broad and
plaited leaves. Indeed there are many other varieties&mdash;including
double-flowered ones&mdash;but it is doubtful
if the ordinary observer would see any great difference
between them and the best forms of the common
Snowdrop. They all have roundish bulbs--; some
larger than others, and offsets are freely produced<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78] </span>
from them. They flourish in the border or rock-garden
in rich sandy soil and leaf-mould, but their
natural dwelling place is in the grass, where they
should be planted in hundreds and thousands and
left to take care of themselves, as they are in many
gardens in the kingdom.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="GALTONIA" id="GALTONIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">GALTONIA</a></b> (<b>Hyacinthus</b>) <b>candicans.</b>&mdash;A noble-looking
South African plant, with large roundish
bulbs and strap-shaped leaves over 2 feet long. The
pure white sweet-scented blossoms (shown on <a href="#PLATE_20">Plate 20</a>,
fig. 78) appear during the summer months, 20 or 30
in a raceme, drooping from stout stalks about 4 feet
high. <b>G. princeps</b> is somewhat similar but not so
attractive in appearance, as its white flowers are
faintly tinged with green. Both kinds flourish in
good garden soil and should be planted in bold
clumps for effect in the flower border, and in warm
sunny spots, where they may remain undisturbed for
several years, until it is necessary to give them more
space, or to detach the offsets for increasing the stock.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="GLADIOLUS" id="GLADIOLUS"></a><a href="#INDEX">GLADIOLUS</a></b> (<i>Corn Flag</i>; <i>Sword Lily</i>).&mdash;There are
several species of Gladiolus rarely seen outside botanic
gardens. The florists' varieties, like <i>brenchleyensis</i>,
<i>Colvillei</i>, <i>Childsi</i>, <i>gandavensis</i>, <i>Lemoinei</i>, and <i>nanceianus</i>,
are much more popular owing to the brilliancy and
beauty of their blossoms. <i>G. brenchleyensis</i> (practically<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79] </span>
a form of <i>gandavensis</i>) is remarkable for its glowing
scarlet flowers; <i>G. Childsi</i> (raised from <i>gandavensis</i>
and <i>Saundersi</i>) attains a height of four or five feet, and
has spikes of bloom often 2 feet or more long. The
blossoms are 6 to 9 inches across, and possess many
shades of purple, scarlet, crimson, salmon, white, pink,
yellow, often beautifully mottled and blotched in the
throat (<a href="#PLATE_28">Plate 28</a>, fig. 105). <i>G. Colvillei</i> (raised from
<i>cardinalis</i> and <i>tristis</i>) is an early-flowering plant about
2 feet high, with crimson purple and also pure white
flowers&mdash;according to the variety. The form known
as "The Bride" is the best white (<a href="#PLATE_21">Plate 21</a>, fig. 81).
Other early-flowering forms are shown in figs. 82 and
83. <i>G. gandavensis</i> (raised from <i>cardinalis</i> and <i>psittacinus</i>)
forms a charming group as various in colour
as the <i>Childsi</i> forms, the individual flowers being
variously striped and blotched with distinct colours.
<i>G. Lemoinei</i> (raised from <i>purpureo-auratus</i> and <i>gandavensis</i>)
is the origin of a beautiful number of
hybrids, distinguished by having a large golden-yellow
blotch on the lower segments, bordered with
scarlet, crimson, purple, maroon, &amp;c. <a href="#PLATE_28">(Plate 28</a>,
fig. 104). The colours are as numerous and as
delicate as in the <i>Childsi</i> and <i>gandavensis</i> sections.
The <i>nanceianus</i> hybrids are remarkably fine plants,
and are only comparable with those of the <i>Childsi</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 80] </span>
group, although the blossoms are not quite so large.
The colours vary from purple, claret, violet, carmine,
orange, red, scarlet, violet, &amp;c., and are all spotted in
various ways (see <a href="#PLATE_28">Plate 28</a>, fig. 103).</p>

<p>The kinds of Gladioli just mentioned may be
grown to perfection in a well-drained loamy soil,
which has been deeply dug and well manured the
autumn previous to planting. From the beginning to
the end of March is an excellent time to plant the
corms or tubers, each one being inserted in a hole
made with a stout dibber, or in a drill about 4 or 5 inches
deep, and about a foot apart. Having covered the
corms and made the soil fairly firm, little more is
needed beyond keeping weeds down, until the flower
spikes begin to show in July and August. Short
stakes may then be supplied so as to keep the trusses
upright. To secure extra fine blossoms the plants,
when well-established, should be watered two or three
times a week with liquid cow-manure to which a little
soot and guano has been added. During hot dry
summers especially, copious waterings should be given.</p>

<p>When the flowers have faded, and the leaves begin
to turn yellow, the corms may be taken up and carefully
stored in a dry, airy, frost-proof place until the
following March. New plants may be raised from the
offsets, and also the spawn or cloves to be found at<span class="pagenum">[Pg 81] </span>
the base of the new corms. They should be detached
and stored, and the following April may be sown like
seeds in drills about two inches deep. The larger
corms may also be carefully cut in two at planting
time, the cut surfaces being dipped in powdered
charcoal, soot, or freshly-slaked lime.</p>

<p>Where space will permit, the following natural
species of Gladioli may also be grown:&mdash;<i>G. blandus</i>,
1 to 2 feet high, white, with red markings and a yellow
tube; <i>G. byzantinus</i>, 2 feet, red, shaded with violet or
purple; <i>G. dracocephalus</i>, 1 to 2-1/2 feet, soft yellow,
striped and spotted with purple; <i>G. floribundus</i>, 1 foot,
has flowers varying from white to flesh colour and
deep red.</p>

<p><i>G. oppositiflorus</i> has white flowers, washed with
rose or purple (<a href="#PLATE_23">Plate 23</a>, fig. 87); <i>G. psittacinus</i>, 3 feet,
rich scarlet, lined and spotted with yellow; <i>G. purpureo-auratus</i>,
3 to 4 feet, sulphur yellow, blotched
with purple; and <i>G. Saundersi</i>, 2 to 3 feet, crimson
or soft scarlet, spotted with pink and white. As they
are all natives of South Africa they should be planted
in warm sunny spots in March or April, and lifted the
following autumn when growth has ceased.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="HABRANTHUS" id="HABRANTHUS"></a><a href="#INDEX">HABRANTHUS</a> pratensis.</b>&mdash;A pretty Chilian
plant, with ovoid bulbs about 1-1/2 inches through, and
narrow leaves 1 to 1-1/2 feet long. The funnel-shaped,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 82] </span>
orange-red or scarlet blossoms appear in early summer
on stems 1 to 2 feet high. Rich sandy-loam and
leaf-soil, and warm sheltered spots are most suitable
for this plant. In bleak localities the bulbs must be
protected in winter. Increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="HYACINTHUS" id="HYACINTHUS"></a><a href="#INDEX">HYACINTHUS</a></b> (<i>Hyacinth</i>).&mdash;The florists' Hyacinth,
evolved from <i>H. orientalis</i>, has been for generations a
great garden favourite, and is still amongst the
most popular of bulbous plants for the decoration of
the out-door garden, or for growing in conservatories,
or the dwelling-house in more or less ornamental
receptacles. There is a good deal of difference in the
size of Hyacinth bulbs, but the reader must not
imagine that the largest bulbs will throw up the best
truss of flowers. Indeed it is often the case that
quite a small bulb comparatively, will give a finer
display than one much larger. Size, therefore, is not
the main point about Hyacinth bulbs. Weight or
density is the most important feature, and bulbs that are
in any way soft or flabby may be regarded as useless.</p>

<p><b><a href="#INDEX">Hyacinths in the Open Air.</a></b>&mdash;What are known
as "Bedding Hyacinths," to be had in various
colours&mdash;red, rose, pink, white, blue, violet and
yellow&mdash;are generally grown out of doors. They
should be planted in October, or not later than
November, 5 to 6 inches deep, and 6 to 8 inches apart,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 83] </span>
care being taken when planting round, oval, oblong,
or other shaped beds to keep the lines or curves
equidistant so as to secure uniformity in the results.
The varieties should not be mixed when formal beds
are planted. In vacant spaces in the flower border,
however, mixed Hyacinths look very well. Although
these Hyacinths will grow well in ordinary good
garden soil that has been deeply dug, and contains some
well-decayed manure, it may be said that a light sandy
loam that has had some old cow-manure incorporated
with it some weeks previously is regarded as the best.
When the soil is naturally heavy it must be well
turned up, and have plenty of sand or grit mixed with it
as well as old manure. In such a soil, a further precaution
may be taken to have a handful of sand placed in
the hole under each bulb to further improve the drainage.</p>

<p>Combinations with out-door Hyacinths are sometimes
made by covering the surface of the beds with
such plants as Forget-me-Nots, Polyanthuses or
Primroses, Silenes, White Arabis, Yellow Alyssum,
and sometimes Narcissi bulbs are planted alternately
with the Hyacinths, the object in all cases being to
produce a fine effect and contrast in colours in spring.
When the plants are in bloom they require but little
attention, except perhaps a slender stick here and
there to some flower-truss that has been blown down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a>  </span>
by the wind, or topples over with its own weight. As
soon as the blossoms have withered, the flower stems
should be cut away, leaving the still green leaves to
assimilate food until they begin to turn yellow. The
yellowing leaves indicate that the bulbs may be taken
up, dried, and cleaned, and stored away in cool airy
places until the following September or October. As
Hyacinths, however, deteriorate in our fickle climate,
it is better to buy new bulbs each year for planting
formal beds, while the old ones may be planted in
ordinary flower border or shrubbery.</p>

<p><b><a name="Hyacinths_in_Glasses" id="Hyacinths_in_Glasses"></a><a href="#INDEX">Hyacinths in Glasses,</a> &amp;c.</b>&mdash;Ornamental bowls,
glasses, vases, &amp;c., of various designs afford an easy
and interesting means for growing Hyacinths in the
dwelling house. Many fail to have good results with
Hyacinths grown in these receptacles because they
allow the bulbs to touch the water, or they place them
in too high a temperature to begin with. The bulbs
should not actually touch the water, the base being
little more than 1/8-inch away from the surface. They
should then be stood in a dark place with a temperature
of about 40° to 45° F., until roots have developed
into the water. The plants may then be exposed to
more light, after which all that is necessary is to
change the water occasionally, about once a week, so
that the roots may secure a fresh supply of oxygen.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 85] </span>
The finest bulbs give the best results naturally when
grown in this way. What are known as "Miniature
Hyacinths" are suitable for growing in bowls, vases,
&amp;c., in moist moss and charcoal, or in Jadoo fibre, or
even in coco-nut fibre. Indeed, Hyacinths generally
may be grown more easily, perhaps, in this way, instead
of in water, the only point to bear in mind being
to get the roots started in a cool place before the
flower-stem and leaves begin to grow.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Hyacinths_in_Pots" id="Hyacinths_in_Pots"></a><a href="#INDEX">Hyacinths in Pots.</a></b>&mdash;For greenhouse and conservatory
decoration Hyacinths are most useful. One large
bulb or three smaller ones may be placed in a 5-inch
pot in light sandy soil, the top of the bulbs being well
above the surface. The pots should be placed in the
open air and covered with fine ashes or coco-nut fibre.
Roots soon develop, after which the bulbs may be
brought in as required, and can be had in blossom
long before those in the open ground begin to appear.
In warm greenhouses the graceful Roman and Italian
Hyacinths may be flowered in the same way.</p>

<p>For a selection of Hyacinths of various colours
the reader will find it best to consult a good bulb
catalogue or a nurseryman. <a href="#PLATE_11">Plate 11</a> shows a few
varieties, but the size of the page renders it impossible
to show them in all their natural grandeur.</p>

<p>Besides the florist's Hyacinths there are one or<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86] </span>
two natural species that are worth growing in the
rockery, flower border, or in the grass. These are the
Spanish Hyacinth (<i>H. amethystinus</i>), with bright blue
drooping blossoms, or white in the variety <i>albus</i>, in
May and June (see <a href="#PLATE_7">Plate 7</a>, fig. 30). The other is
<i>H. azureus</i>, which very much resembles one of the
Muscaris, and sends up its sky-blue drooping flowers
as early as February (see <a href="#PLATE_2">Plate 2</a>, fig. 10).</p>

<p>Hyacinths may be increased by offsets. These
may be stored in dry sand until planting time in the
autumn, when they should be placed in beds by themselves,
and will reach the flowering stage, with care,
in two or three seasons. Full-sized bulbs are induced
to develop bulblets by cutting them cross-wise, about
half-way through from the base, or scooping the bottom
out into a hollow. The bulbs are placed to dry after
cutting, and by and bye the bulblets appear. They
may be detached and planted like the offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="IRIS" id="IRIS"></a><a href="#INDEX">IRIS</a></b> (<i>Flag</i>).&mdash;As the various kinds of Irises, known
as "rhizomatous," "bearded," "beardless," and "oncocyclus
or cushion," have already been dealt with in
"<span class="smcap">A Practical Guide to Garden Plants</span>," and in the
companion volume to this, "<span class="smcap">Beautiful Garden
Flowers</span>," it is only necessary here to refer to the
"Bulbous" Irises, as coming appropriately within the
scope of this work. The best-known examples of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87] </span>
Bulbous, or Xiphion Irises, as they are sometimes
called, are the Spanish Iris (<i>I. Xiphium</i>) and the
English Iris (<i>I. xiphioides</i>). Varieties of the last-named
are shown on Plate 14, while forms of the Spanish Iris
will be found in "<span class="smcap">Beautiful Garden Flowers</span>," Plate
20, and also in this work, Plate 15. Besides these
well-known examples of Bulbous Irises, there are many
others now well-known. They are, however, much
smaller in stature as a rule, more fragile, so utterly
distinct in appearance from the ordinary Flag Irises,
and so curiously and beautifully coloured, that many
amateurs liken them to orchids, although, perhaps,
they can scarcely be termed "<a name="Poor_Mens" id="Poor_Mens"></a><a href="#INDEX">Poor Men's</a>" Orchids
like their commoner relatives. On Plate 3, five species
of charming and early flowering Bulbous Irises are
shown, and a glance will show that no description could
do real justice to the charming beauty of the blossoms.</p>

<p>The following comprise some of the best kinds of
Bulbous Irises:&mdash;<i>I. alata</i>, and its numerous varieties,
bright lilac-purple to white, October to December;
<i>I. Bakeriana</i> (<a href="#PLATE_3">fig. 12</a>), sky blue and white, blotched
with violet, January to March; <i>I. Boissieri</i>, reddish
purple, June; <i>I. caucasica</i>, pale yellow, February and

has<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88] </span>
reddish-purple and golden-yellow, with purple veins

<p>The Spanish and English Irises flourish in ordinary
good and well-drained garden soil containing a fair
amount of sand or grit, and humus. The English
varieties on the whole require a somewhat moister
situation and rather heavier soil than the Spanish.
They flower profusely, and their many shades of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a>  </span>
colour make the long-stalked blossoms great favourites
for decorative purposes. The different colours can be
had separately from the nurseryman or florist, but a
mixed collection will afford great pleasure to those
who do not wish to be burdened with the fancy
names given in catalogues.</p>

<p>The smaller kinds of Bulbous Irises&mdash;like those
shown on <a href="#PLATE_3">Plate 3</a>&mdash;require to be treated a little more
carefully than the Spanish and English varieties.
Indeed many of the choicer and rarer varieties are
safer grown in pots of rich sandy soil in cold frames.
They flower early in the year, and, if exposed in the
open border or rock-garden, the blossoms would be
probably not only considerably disfigured, but the
cold rains and frosts might kill the bulbs. When
grown in the open air, warm sheltered spots should be
selected for them, and the soil should be a well-drained
sandy loam with a little leaf-soil. If the plants are
flourishing, they may be left in the same spot for
three or four seasons. After this it is better to lift
them when the leaves have withered, and then any
offsets may be detached to increase the stock. As
a rule the best time to plant bulbous Irises is in
September or October, but not later.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="IXIA" id="IXIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">IXIA</a></b> (<b>African Corn Lily</b>).--If the reader will turn
to Plate 1, he or she will at once admit that the Ixias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a>  </span>
are a charming class of bulbous plants. The picture
was prepared from specimens kindly supplied by
Messrs. Wallace &amp; Co., of Colchester. There are
many other shades and combinations of colour besides
those represented, and happy would be the amateur
who succeeded in raising such lovely flowers in his
garden&mdash;either in the open air or under glass.</p>

<p>The Ixias are natives of South Africa, and have
smooth or fibrous-coated, round and flattish corms,
about an inch in diameter. The sword-shaped leaves
are strongly veined, and the beautiful blossoms are
borne on stems 1 to 2 feet, during June and July.
Some of the best varieties are shown on Plate 1, and
attention is especially directed to the charming soft
sea-green flowers of <i>I. viridiflora</i>, having a dark
blotch in the centre. To these may be added the
deep-red or crimson-flowered <i>speciosa</i> or <i>crateroides</i>.</p>

<p>It is a pity that such elegant flowers cannot be
grown in the open air in every part of the British
Islands. Unfortunately they are not hardy enough
for this, and consequently the best results out of doors
are only likely to be secured in the mildest parts of
the kingdom. The best time to plant is from September
to November. The corms should be about
3 inches beneath the surface of the soil. This should
be a light, sandy loam; if inclined to be heavy, it<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91] </span>
should be raised in small beds above the general level
to secure better drainage, and a little sand may be
placed round each corm, also with the same object in
view. In the event of cold rains and frosts in winter,
the bulbs should be protected with litter, bracken, &amp;c.,
to be removed at the end of February or March when
the leaves begin to appear.</p>

<p>Where it is impossible to grow Ixias successfully
in the open air, they may be grown in pots in cold
frames or for the decoration of the greenhouse or
conservatory. The corms should be potted in September
or October, and kept under ashes or fibre in
the open until roots have developed, after which they
may be brought inside to develop. Ixias are best
increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="IXIOLIRION" id="IXIOLIRION"></a><a href="#INDEX">IXIOLIRION</a> montanum.</b>&mdash;This beautiful plant
(also known as <i>I. Pallasi</i> and <i>I. tataricum</i>) has long-necked
ovoid bulbs about an inch in diameter, and
tufts of grassy leaves. The charming lilac blossoms,
as shown on <a href="#PLATE_18">Plate 18</a>, fig. 73, are borne in early
summer in loose clusters on stems a foot or more high,
and are very useful in a cut state. There is a good
deal of variation in the colour, which has led to
different names being given from time to time.</p>

<p><i>I. <a href="#INDEX">Kolpakowskyanum</a></i> is a rare and little known
species from Turkestan. It has much smaller bulbs<span class="pagenum">[Pg 92] </span>
than <i>montanum</i>, and the blue or whitish blossoms
appear somewhat earlier in the year.</p>

<p>Ixiolirions may be grown successfully in the milder
parts of the kingdom in warm sheltered spots in
the flower-border or rock-garden. They should be
planted about 3 inches deep in September or October
in light sandy soil, and in cold localities should be
protected with litter, &amp;c., in winter.</p><br>

South African plant, 6 to 12 inches high, with irregular
roundish corms about 2 inches in diameter, and
narrow sword-shaped leaves. The deep crimson or
blood-red blossoms, with a still deeper-coloured blotch
on each of the three inner segments, appear in late
summer in loose clusters on slender stalks, and are
very striking when seen in large masses. This species,
although perhaps a trifle hardier, may be grown in
the same way as the Ixias (see <a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>). The corms,
however, being larger, should be planted about
6 inches deep, and new plants may be secured by
detaching the offsets when the leaves have withered.</p>

<p><b><a name="LEUCOJUM" id="LEUCOJUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">LEUCOJUM</a></b> (<i>Snowflake</i>).&mdash;Beautiful plants closely
related to the Snowdrops, and somewhat resembling
them in bulbs, and leaves, and flowers. The Spring
Snowflake (<i>L. vernum</i>) is the first of the group to
produce its drooping sweet-scented blossoms in March<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a>  </span>
and April. They are usually borne singly on a
slender stalk 6 to 12 inches high, and are white in
colour with more or less conspicuous green tips to the
petals, as shown in <a href="#PLATE_12">Plate 12</a>, fig. 47. The next best-known
kind is the Summer Snowflake&mdash;the paradoxical
name of <i>L. æstivum</i>. The pure white flowers, tipped
with green, appear in May and June, sometimes as
many as six being borne on a stem. <i>L. pulchellum</i> is
closely related to this species, but has narrower leaves,
and produces its smaller blossoms somewhat later.
The pretty little plants, formerly known as <a href="#INDEX"><i>Acis</i></a>, are
now included with the Leucojums. They all have
small white drooping blossoms on slender stems 6 to
12 inches high, those of <i>hyemalis</i> and <i>trichophylla</i>,
appearing in April, while those of <i>autumnalis</i> appear
in autumn.</p>

<p>The Snowflakes flourish in rich sandy soil, and
appear to advantage in the rock-garden or in the
grass, where they may be massed in the same way as
Snowdrops, &amp;c. Most of them are easily increased by
offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="LILIUM" id="LILIUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">LILIUM</a></b> (<i>Lily</i>).&mdash;Of all the hardy bulbous plants
that may be grown in the open air in our climate, the
Lilies may be looked upon as the most noble. Not
only are many of them giants in stature among other
hardy bulbs, but there is nothing to equal their<span class="pagenum">[Pg 94] </span>
individual blossoms in size, or their general gracefulness
of appearance when borne collectively on the
leafy stems.</p>

<p>They differ in another respect from other bulbous
plants described in this book, and that is in having
"scaly" bulbs as shown on <a href="#Page_12">page 12</a>. All the other
plants have either bulbs with several coats rolled
round each other (tunicated), or else they are solid,
when they are known as corms. But in the Lilies
neither of these two types appears. What are known
as the "scales" are fleshy leaves that have been
specially modified under the surface of the soil to act
as reservoirs or storehouses for the surplus food that
the green aërial leaves on the stems have elaborated
for them during the daytime.</p>

<p>There are a large number of species of Lilium,
differing greatly in size and blossom, and it is therefore
only natural to expect the bulbs to vary a good
deal also. Indeed, there are very large and very
small bulbs, comparatively speaking, and they display
a good deal of difference in their vegetation, and in
producing offsets. For example, most kinds develop
new bulbs or offsets round the base of the older bulb,
while others, like <i>canadense</i>, <i>Grayi</i>, <i>pardalinum</i>, <i>Parryi</i>,
and <i>superbum</i>, develop their new bulbs along creeping
stems or rhizomes as shown in the sketch on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a>  </span>
<a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>.</p>

<p>Useful as the offsets are for the purpose of increasing
the stock, some kinds, notably <i>bulbiferum</i>,
<i>Browni</i>, <i>speciosum</i>, and <i>tigrinum</i>, often develop what
are called "bulbils" in the axils of the aërial leaves.
These bulbils are small bulb-like bodies, which, when
sown and covered with soil as if they were large
seeds, will develop into flowering bulbs in the course
of two or three years. The origin of these bulbils is
more fully dealt with at <a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>.</p>

<p>Besides these two fairly easy means of increasing
the stock of Lilies, many kinds may be also raised
from seeds, which at the end of three, six, or eight
years, will have produced bulbs large enough to throw
up flowering stems. Raising Lilies from seed is more
common now than it used to be, especially in America,
where some lovely hybrids have been raised, such as
<i>Burbanki</i>, <i>Dalhansoni</i>, <i>Marhan</i>, &amp;c.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Distribution_of_Lilies" id="Distribution_of_Lilies"></a><a href="#INDEX">Distribution of Lilies.</a></b>&mdash;As Liliums are distributed
throughout all parts of the north temperate
hemisphere&mdash;extending from California in the west, to
China and Japan in the east, across the continents of
North America, Europe, and Asia&mdash;they are therefore
found naturally growing in different soils, and
under various climatic conditions, in all degrees of
sunshine and shadow, drought and moisture. In the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 96] </span>
British flower garden they are, as a rule, best in
positions where they will be shaded from the hot mid-day
sun, as the flowers will last much longer than if
exposed too much. They should not, however, be
planted in deep shade under trees, or among their
roots, as the latter would absorb too much food and
moisture from the Lilies, while the overhanging boughs
would prevent the rain from reaching the bulbs in
sufficient quantity. During vigorous growth, Lilies
like plenty of water, but the soil must at the same
time be so well drained that it shall readily pass away
from the bulbs. ("<span class="smcap">A Practical Guide to Garden
Plants.</span>")</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Time_and_Depth_of_Planting" id="Time_and_Depth_of_Planting"></a><a href="#INDEX">Time and Depth of Planting.</a></b>&mdash;If bulbs can be
secured early in autumn, say in September or October,
that would be the best time to plant Lilies. But very
often bulbs of certain kinds cannot be secured till
spring, so that planting must necessarily take place
then. The depth at which Lily bulbs are to be planted
depends greatly upon the size of the individual bulbs;
some kinds are planted about 6 inches deep, while
others require a depth of 9 or 10 inches. A safe
general rule to follow, is to cover the bulbs with about
twice their own depth of soil when planting in the
open air. If a piece of peat be placed beneath each
bulb at the time of planting, and a layer of sand about<span class="pagenum">[Pg 97] </span>
half-an-inch thick round them, they will root much
more freely. An exception to the general rule seems to
be <i>L. giganteum</i> (see <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>). When Liliums are hardy
enough to be left undisturbed for several seasons in
the same place, a good top-dressing or "mulching" of
well-decayed manure in autumn will be of great
advantage in replenishing the food for the roots.</p>

arranged in three distinct groups as follows:&mdash;</p>

they may be planted in clumps in borders or shrubberies<span class="pagenum">[Pg 105] </span>
where they will have plenty of space and
enough sunshine to enable them to develop fully.

<p><b><a name="LYCORIS" id="LYCORIS"></a><a href="#INDEX">LYCORIS</a> squamigera.</b>&mdash;This distinct Japanese
plant is closely related to the Belladonna Lily
(see <a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>). It has rather long-necked roundish bulbs,
2 to 3 inches in diameter, and strap-shaped leaves about
a foot long. From July to September, after the leaves
have withered, the large sweet-scented rosy-lilac
flowers (see <a href="#PLATE_32">Plate 32</a>, fig. 116) are borne on a stout stalk
2 to 3 feet high. This plant may be grown out of
doors in the milder parts of the kingdom in warm
sheltered spots, such as against a well on a south
border. It likes rich well-drained sandy loam and
leaf-soil, but grows freely in ordinary good garden
soil. There are other species that may probably succeed
in the open air in the same way, such as
<i>aurea</i>, golden-yellow; <i>straminea</i>, pale yellow with
a pink central line and red dots; and <i>radiata</i>, bright
red.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="MERENDERA" id="MERENDERA"></a><a href="#INDEX">MERENDERA</a> Bulbocodium.</b>&mdash;A pretty Pyrenean
plant closely related to <i>Bulbocodium vernum</i>. It grows
only 3 or 4 inches high, and produces its rosy-lilac<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106] </span>
funnel-shaped flowers in autumn at the same time as
some of the true Colchicums. The narrow sickle-shaped
leaves appear after the flowers are over and
remain fresh and green till spring. There are a few
other species, but they are practically unknown in
gardens. The Merendera may be grown exactly
in the same way as the Colchicums, in the border,
rock-garden, or best of all in the grass. The stock
may be increased by offsets and seeds.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="MILLA" id="MILLA"></a><a href="#INDEX">MILLA</a> biflora.</b>&mdash;There is now only one Milla, the
plants formerly known under that name being now
included in the genus Brodiæa (see <a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>). <i>M. biflora</i>
has rather small bulbs with fleshy roots and narrow,
grass-like, blue-green leaves. The pretty pure white
salver-shaped blossoms appear in August and September
usually two to four on stems about 6 inches
high. Being a native of Mexico, <i>M. biflora</i> should be
grown in warm sheltered spots in the rock-garden or
border, in a rich sandy loam, the bulbs being planted
about 4 inches deep. Increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="MUSCARI" id="MUSCARI"></a><a href="#INDEX">MUSCARI</a></b> (<i>Grape Hyacinth</i>).&mdash;A charming class of
plants with roundish bulbs about 1 inch in diameter,
narrow leaves, and conical clusters of urn-shaped or
tubular blossoms drooping from stems 3 to 6 inches
high. Although the Grape Hyacinths may be easily
grown in patches or edgings in the ordinary flower<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107] </span>
border, there is no place that shows off their
sheets of brilliant blue blossoms so well as a
grassy bank, or a nook in the rockery, where they
should be planted in large numbers. They naturally
like a rich and well drained soil with plenty of grit
or sand in it, and some leaf-soil. The bulbs should
be planted about 3 inches deep in September and
October, and when naturalised in the grass may be
left for several seasons without being disturbed.
Most of the kinds blossom in March, April, and May,
and are easily increased by offsets. Seeds may also
be sown (see <a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>).</p>

<p>The following is a selection of the best kinds. The
flowers are blue in all cases, except where otherwise
mentioned, and the general appearance of the blossoms
is as shown by <i>M. conicum</i> in <a href="#PLATE_12">Plate 12</a>, fig. 48:&mdash;<i>Armeniacum</i>;
<i>botryoides</i>, with a white-flowered variety
<i>album</i>; <i>comosum</i>, the monstrous form of which, with
twisted and wavy bluish-violet filaments, is known as

<i>botryoides</i>, but larger; <i>Maweanum</i>; <i>neglectum</i>; <i>racemosum</i>;
<i>amphibolus</i> porcelain blue; and <i>Szovitsianum</i>.</p>

<p>There are other colours besides blue among the
Grape Hyacinths. Thus the "<a href="#INDEX">Musk Hyacinth</a>" (<i>M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a>  </span>
moschatum</i>) has sweet-scented blossoms which change
from purple at first to greenish-yellow tinged with
violet. It has a yellow flowered variety called <i>flavum</i>
or <i>macrocarpum</i>. Some forms of <i>neglectum</i> are salmon-pink,
while the blossoms of <i>M. paradoxum</i> might be
described almost as black.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="NARCISSUS" id="NARCISSUS"></a><a href="#INDEX">NARCISSUS</a></b> (<i>Daffodil</i>).&mdash;What so charming in the
spring-time as "a host of Golden Daffodils"? The
varieties are now almost legion, and they are still
being added to by enthusiastic hybridists in various
parts of the kingdom. The crossing of one section with
another may possibly worry the botanist, but there is
no fear that the gardener will not welcome any new
variety that may be raised. Although thousands of
the older Daffodils may be bought for a few shillings,
the rarer varieties still command a respectably high
price, and will naturally continue to do so until the
stock has been considerably increased.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a nook in the garden, large or
small, where Daffodils cannot be grown. And yet it
is astonishing to note their general absence from
suburban gardens, where they would not only grow
freely, but also make a cheerful picture in the spring-time.</p>

<p>Daffodils&mdash;with the exception, perhaps, of a very
few varieties&mdash;require as little attention, and even<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109] </span>
less than Snowdrops or Crocuses. Once planted they
may be left undisturbed for years, and as each season
comes round they gaily shoot their blue-green strap-shaped
leaves and creamy or golden blossoms through
the ground.</p>

<p>They grow in almost any soil, but prefer a rather
stiff and well-drained loam. They are appropriate
in any situation in the flower border or rockery.
But their natural position is undoubtedly in the
grass, or&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">"Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</div>
<div class="poem">Fluttering and dancing in the breeze,"</div>


<p>As Wordsworth has it.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="When_to_Plant" id="When_to_Plant"></a><a href="#INDEX">When to Plant.</a></b>&mdash;The best time to plant Daffodil
bulbs is from the end of August to November. As
there is a great difference in the size of the bulbs,
according to the variety, the depth of planting should
vary accordingly. Thus bulbs 1 to 2 inches deep
from top of neck to base should be planted quite
3 or 4 inches deep, while larger ones will be planted
4 to 6 inches deep in proportion, and about the
same distance apart, except, of course, when they are
used between other plants like Tulips, Wallflowers,
Polyanthuses, &amp;c., for a combination display in spring.</p>

<p>Most of the Daffodils are valuable for cutting and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110] </span>
decorative purposes generally when in season, and
when one has the convenience of a greenhouse&mdash;cold
or otherwise&mdash;the flowering period can be extended
from Christmas onwards.</p>

<p>Daffodils are most easily increased by the offsets
from the old bulbs. These may be lifted in early
summer, when the leaves have begun to turn yellow.
Seeds may also be sown when ripe (see <a href="#Page_36">page 36</a>),
but to secure them the plants must be left much
longer in the ground, so as to mature them.</p>

<p>Nearly all kinds of Daffodils&mdash;especially those
having only one flower on a stem&mdash;may be grown in
the open air. There are hundreds of varieties to
choose from, but the uninitiated may start with such
kinds as the beautiful white and flat-flowered "Poet's
Narcissus" (<i><a name="N_poeticus" id="N_poeticus"></a><a href="#INDEX">N. poeticus</a></i>), which is also called the
"Pheasant's Eye" Narcissus, because of the crimson
and orange circles round the rim of the flat saucer-like
"corona" in the centre (see <a href="#PLATE_7">Plate 7</a>, fig. 29).
There are several varieties of the Poet's Narcissus,
one of the best for ordinary purposes being <i>ornatus</i>.
Where the soil is particularly rich and well-drained
the double-flowered variety, called the "Gardenia"
Narcissus, owing to the shape of its beautiful white
blossoms (see <a href="#PLATE_7">Plate 7</a>, fig. 28), may be grown. Unfortunately<span class="pagenum">[Pg 111] </span>
this variety often comes "blind," that is,
the blossoms remain undeveloped in the papery sheath
on top of the stem. To check this the bulbs are best
lifted and transplanted early to fresh soil. Another
popular and easily-grown Daffodil is the common
Double Yellow one known as <i>Telamonius plenus</i> or
<i>Van Sion</i>. It is a form of the <a name="Tenby" id="Tenby"></a>Tenby Daffodil (<i>N. obvallaris</i>)
which is a single form with beautiful yellow
flowers, having a large "trumpet" or corona in the
centre. Closely related to this is the Great Spanish
Daffodil (<i>N. major</i>) which has large bright lemon-yellow
flowers, which are still larger and of richer
yellow in the variety <i>maximus</i>.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Ajax_Daffodils" id="Ajax_Daffodils"></a><a href="#INDEX">"Ajax"</a> Daffodils.</b>&mdash;To these may be added the
numerous forms, of which the common Lent Lily
(also called "Ajax" or "Trumpet Daffodil") is the
type, and which has pale sulphur-yellow blossoms
with a lemon-yellow "trumpet." Some of the finest
Daffodils, with large spreading flowers and correspondingly
large and deep trumpets, belong to this
section, among which may be mentioned <i>Ard Righ</i>
or <i>Yellow King</i>, <i>C. W. Cowan</i>, <i>Colleen Bawn</i>, <i>Emperor</i>,
<i>Glory of Leiden</i>, <i>Golden Spur</i>, <i>Henry Irving</i>, <i>Hudibras</i>,
<i>John Nelson</i>, <i>Madame de Graaff</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_4">Plate 4</a>, fig. 17),
<i>Monarch</i>, <i>W. Goldring</i>, &amp;c. All these have single
flowers varying in colour from almost pure white (as<span class="pagenum">[Pg 112] </span>
in <i>C. W. Cowan</i>, <i>Colleen Bawn</i>, and <i>Madame de Graaff</i>)
to deep golden-yellow in many of the other varieties.
There are a few double-flowered forms of the "Lent
Lily," the best known being <i>Capax</i>, lemon-yellow;
<i>grandiplenus</i>, deep yellow, <i>plenissimus</i>, and the Old
Double Lent Lily grown in Gerarde's garden over
300 years ago.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Bicolor_Daffodils" id="Bicolor_Daffodils"></a><a href="#INDEX">"Bicolor"</a> Daffodils.</b>&mdash;Another very fine group of
Trumpet Daffodils are those known as "bicolors,"
so called because the spreading segments are one
colour (generally white or creamy), while the trumpet
is another colour (usually some shade of soft or deep
yellow). Amongst the most popular forms in this
group may be mentioned <i>Ellen Willmott</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_4">Plate 4</a>,
fig. 16), <i>Empress, Grandee</i>, <i>Horsfieldi</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_4">Plate 4</a>,
fig. 18), <i>Mrs. J. B. M. Camm</i>, <i>Mrs. Morland Crossfield,</i>
<i>Mrs. Walter T. Ware</i>, <i>Princeps</i> or <i>Irish Giant, Victoria,</i>
and <i>Weardale Perfection</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_6">Plate 6</a>, fig. 26).</p><br>

<p>The "<b><a name="Star_Daffodils" id="Star_Daffodils"></a><a href="#INDEX">Star Daffodils</a></b>" (<i>N. incomparabilis</i>) have
spreading starry petals, and a cup or chalice-like
corona or trumpet in the centre. They are a very
free growing group, the commoner kinds of which
(such as <i>Autocrat</i>, <i>Cynosure</i>, <i>Stella</i>) may be naturalised
in thousands in the grass, where they may be seen at
"a glance tossing their heads in sprightly dance."
Some other very fine forms are <i>C. J. Backhouse</i>,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113] </span>
<i>Frank Miles</i>, <i>Geo. Nicholson</i>, <i>Gloria Mundi</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_5">Plate
5</a>, fig. 21), <i>Lulworth</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_6">Plate 6</a>, fig. 27), <i>Mary
Anderson</i>, <i>Sir Watkin</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_5">Plate 5</a>, fig. 23), and
<i>Princess Mary of Cambridge</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_5">Plate 5</a>, fig. 21), &amp;c.,
but there are many others. There are also several
double varieties of Star Daffodils, the most common
being "<a name="Butter_and_Eggs" id="Butter_and_Eggs"></a><a href="#INDEX">Butter and Eggs,</a>" <i>Orange Phoenix</i> (or <i>Eggs and
Bacon</i>) and <i>Sulphur Phoenix</i> (or <i><a name="Codlins_and_Cream" id="Codlins_and_Cream"></a>Codlins and Cream</i>).</p>

<p>There are many other kinds of Daffodils which
have only one flower on a stem, many of them being
natural or artificial hybrids. Space will not permit
detailed descriptions, but the following may be looked
upon as the best:&mdash;<i>Backhousei</i>, <i>Barri</i> (with several
forms), <i>Bernardi</i>, <i>Burbidgei</i>, (with several forms),
<i>gracilis</i>, <i>Humei</i>, <i>intermedius</i>, <i>Johnstoni</i> (with several
forms), <i>Leedsi</i> (with several fine forms), <i>Macleayi</i>,
<i>moschatus</i> (with several forms, the best being <i>cernuus</i>),
<i>muticus</i>, and <i>Nelsoni</i> (with several forms).</p>

<p>In the foregoing sections the blossoms are all
of a fairly large size, and borne on stalks a foot
or more high. There is, however a charming
group in which the blossoms are in most cases comparatively
small and the flower stalks short. These
kinds are valuable for planting in bold masses
in partially shaded places in the rockery, or in short
grass.</p>

<p><i>N. cyclamineus</i> is a charming little Daffodil. It<span class="pagenum">[Pg 114] </span>
belongs to the Lent Lily group botanically. The
blossoms, however, are much smaller; the segments
being lemon-yellow, and abruptly turned back upon
the stalk from the orange-yellow cylindrical "trumpet."
(See <a href="#PLATE_5">Plate 5</a>, fig. 19.)</p>

<p><i>N. minor</i> is another miniature form of Lent Lily,
with gracefully-twisted sulphur-yellow segments surrounding
a deeper yellow spreading "trumpet." The
variety <i>minimus</i> is smaller still, with rich yellow
flowers, while <i>plenus</i> (or <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>) is a double
variety.</p>

<p>One kind that differs conspicuously from all others
is the "<a name="Hooped_Petticoat" id="Hooped_Petticoat"></a><a href="#INDEX">Hooped Petticoat</a>" or "Medusa Trumpet"
Daffodil (<i>N. Bulbocodium</i>), at one time considered a
distinct genus (<i><a name="Corbularia" id="Corbularia"></a><a href="#INDEX">Corbularia</a></i>). It is a charming species,
having bright-yellow flowers, the chief characteristic
of which is the cone-like or broadly funnel-shaped
trumpet. There are several varieties, such as <i>citrinus</i>
(lemon-yellow), <i>conspicuus</i> (golden-yellow), <i>Graellsi</i>
(primrose-yellow), <i>monophyllus</i> (snow-white, leaves
solitary), <i>nivalis</i>, (orange-yellow).</p>

<p><b><a name="Polyanthus" id="Polyanthus"></a><a href="#INDEX">Polyanthus</a> or Tazetta Narcissus.</b>&mdash;Passing from the
Daffodils with solitary flowers on a stalk, we come to
a small group in which several blossoms adorn the top
of the stem. The most important of these is perhaps
the Polyanthus or Bunch Narcissus (<i>N. Tazetta</i>) which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a>  </span>
was well-known to the old Greek and Roman poets,
although in a wild state it is met with eastwards across
Europe and Asia, to China and Japan. The typical
<i>N. Tazetta</i> has 4 to 8 flowers on top of the stem, the
spreading segments being pure white and the cup-shaped
corona lemon-yellow. There are many varieties,
and although the individual blossoms are not
very large, they are sometimes produced in much
larger numbers than the type. The best-known
varieties are the <i>Scilly White</i>, <i>Grand Soleil d'or</i>, <i>Grand
Monarque</i> (Plate 6, figs. 24 and 25), and the <i>Paper
White</i>&mdash;all largely grown in the open air in the
Scilly Isles&mdash;but rather too tender for out-door
cultivation in less favoured parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Of late years, a Chinese form (really only <i>N.
Tazetta</i>) called the "<a href="#INDEX">Sacred Lily</a>" or "<a href="#INDEX">Joss Flower</a>,"
has attracted attention, and has been recommended
for growing in ornamental bowls, &amp;c., in drawing-rooms,
in a compost (if it can be called such) of pebbles
and clean water. The common mistake made in
growing the Joss Lily in this way is that the plants
do not get sufficient light in ordinary rooms, and consequently
both leaves and stems are too weak to stand
erect.</p>

<p>Other Daffodils with several flowers on a stalk are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a>  </span>
the Sweet-Scented Jonquil (<i><a href="#INDEX">N. Jonquilla</a></i>), easily
recognised by its roundish leaves and rich yellow
flowers with a cup-shaped corona. There are several
varieties including a double one known as "Queen
Anne's Jonquil." The Rush-leaved Jonquil (<i>N. juncifolius</i>)
with roundish rush-like leaves is closely
related, its bright yellow blossoms being distinguished
from those of the Jonquil by being fewer and having
broader ovate segments.</p>

<p><i>N. triandrus</i>, popularly called "<a href="#INDEX">Ganymede's Cup,</a>"
is a charming little species with 1 to 6 pure-white
flowers in which the segments are bent back from the
cup-shaped corona. There are several varieties,
including a lovely white one (<i>albus</i>) called "<a name="Angels_Tears" id="Angels_Tears"></a><a href="#INDEX">Angel's
Tears,</a>" shown on <a href="#PLATE_5">Plate 5</a>, fig. 20. <i>Concolor</i>, pale
yellow; <i>calathinus</i>, white or sulphur-yellow; <i>pallidulus</i>,
primrose-yellow; while <i>pulchellus</i> has primrose-yellow
segments and a white corona.</p>

<p>The bulbs of <i>N. triandrus</i> and its varieties being
rather small&mdash;half to three-quarters of an inch in
diameter&mdash;the spots where they are planted should be
marked, otherwise they are apt to get lost or destroyed.
Until the stock is large they are probably safer grown
in pots in cold frames.</p>

<p>As new varieties and hybrids are being added each
year, the reader who wishes to grow novelties is<span class="pagenum">[Pg 117] </span>
advised to consult the bulb catalogues of such firms as
Messrs. Barr &amp; Sons, Covent Garden; Messrs. Ware,
Feltham; Mr. Hartland, of Cork; Mr. Perry, Winchmore

<p><b><a name="NOTHOSCORDUM" id="NOTHOSCORDUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">NOTHOSCORDUM</a> fragrans.</b>&mdash;A sturdy North
American plant, 1 to 2 feet high, with roundish oblong
bulbs, having thick fleshy roots. It is closely related
to the Alliums, as may be seen by its umbels of white
starry flowers, the segments of which are keeled with
lilac on the outside.</p>

<p>This species grows in ordinary good garden soil of
a gritty nature, and is easily increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="ORNITHOGALUM" id="ORNITHOGALUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">ORNITHOGALUM</a></b> (<i>Star of Bethlehem</i>).&mdash;Although
a large genus, only a few species are considered worth
growing, except in botanical collections. The best
known representative of the group is probably the
Common Star of Bethlehem (<i>O. umbellatum</i>), which is
now naturalised in copses and meadows in some parts
of England, and may be utilised in the same way in
large gardens with an abundance of grass-land. The
clusters of pure-white starry blossoms appear in May
and June, on stalks about 1 foot high, and are keeled
with green behind. Very similar in appearance are
the flowers of <i>O. arabicum</i>, which, however, appear in
June and July, and are much larger, sometimes 2
inches across, with golden anthers, and a shining black<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118] </span>
ovary in the centre, as shown in <a href="#PLATE_29">Plate 29</a>, fig. 107.
Unfortunately, this species is rather tender in the
colder parts of the kingdom, and should be protected
in winter. As an alternative the plants may be
grown in pots in cold greenhouses, or in glasses of
water in the same way as Hyacinths (see <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>.)
<i>O. nutans</i>, the drooping white flowers of which are
also shown on <a href="#PLATE_29">Plate 29</a>, fig. 108, is almost as hardy as
<i>O. umbellatum</i>, and may be naturalised in the same
way. <i>O. arcuatum</i> has pure white erect flowers in
May and June on stalks 2 feet or more high. <i>O.
pyramidale</i>, the white flowers of which have a green
stripe behind, and are borne on stalks 1-1/2 to 2 feet
high in June and July, is another species worth
growing in masses in the shrubberies, or in the grass
(see <a href="#PLATE_19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 74); and <i>O. pyrenaicum</i>, with pale
yellow-green flowers may be given similar treatment.</p>

<p>Ordinary well-drained garden soil of a more or
less sandy nature will suit the Ornithogalums. They
are easily increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="PANCRATIUM" id="PANCRATIUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">PANCRATIUM</a>.</b>&mdash;Most of the plants in this genus
require to be grown in heat and moisture under glass.
Two species, however&mdash;both with clusters of white
sweet-scented flowers on stout stalks 1 to 2 feet high&mdash;can
be grown in the open air in the milder parts of
the British Islands. They are <i>P. illyricum</i> and <i>P</i>.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119] </span>
<i>maritimum</i>, both natives of Southern Europe. They
have large pear-shaped bulbs with a tapering neck
9 to 12 inches long, and consequently require to be
planted pretty deeply, say about a foot in September.
A well-drained sandy loam and leaf-soil suits them
best, and they may be increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="POLIANTHES" id="POLIANTHES"></a><a href="#INDEX">POLIANTHES</a> tuberosa</b> (<i>Tuberose</i>).&mdash;Although what
are known as African, American, Italian, and Pearl
Tuberoses, are usually grown in warm greenhouses,
nevertheless the plants may be grown with a fair
degree of success in the open air in the milder parts
of the kingdom. The thickish bulbs, about 2 inches
through, may be planted out about the end of May,
only just covering the tops with an inch or two of soil.
The thin and narrow leaves will soon appear, and
about August the pure waxy-white heavily-scented
blossoms will be thrown up on stalks 2 to 3 feet high,
that may require a thin stake to keep them erect.
There are single and double-flowered varieties, the
latter being most popular for cultivation under glass.
For this purpose the bulbs may be treated as advised
at <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="PUSCHKINIA" id="PUSCHKINIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">PUSCHKINIA</a> scilloides.</b>&mdash;A charming little plant,
with ovoid bulbs about an inch through, and narrow
leaves about 6 inches long. About March and April
the white or very pale blue blossoms appear, and are<span class="pagenum">[Pg 120] </span>
decorated with a conspicuous deep-blue line down the
centre of each segment. Warm sheltered spots in the
rock-garden or flower border, and a compost of rich
sandy loam and leaf-soil suit this plant best. The
bulbs should be planted, 3 or 4 inches deep, in
September or October (but not later), and may, if
convenient, remain in the same spot for three or four
seasons without being lifted. This is best done when
the foliage has withered, and will give an opportunity
for detaching the offsets to increase the stock.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="SCHIZOSTYLIS" id="SCHIZOSTYLIS"></a><a href="#INDEX">SCHIZOSTYLIS</a> coccinea.</b>&mdash;A charming South
African plant, 2 to 3 feet high, with the appearance of
a Gladiolus in the sword-like leaves. The brilliant
crimson blossoms, each about 2 inches across, appear
from September to November, and consequently often
get spoiled by the weather unless protected. They
are excellent for cutting and valuable so late in the
season. The plants flourish in rich sandy loam, peat
and leaf-soil, and are more satisfactory in the open air
in the mildest parts of the kingdom. In other parts
they should be planted on a sheltered south border
where they can be protected in winter if necessary.
Grown in pots, the plants are popular for greenhouse
decoration. Increase is effected by dividing the
thickish rootstocks in spring.</p>

<p><b><a name="SCILLA" id="SCILLA"></a><a href="#INDEX">SCILLA</a></b> (<i>Squill</i>; <i>Bluebell</i>).&mdash;The Squills and Bluebells
are amongst the most charming of our spring-flowering<span class="pagenum">[Pg 121] </span>
bulbous plants, and it is astonishing that
they are not more extensively utilised for naturalising
in the grass, with Snowdrops, Crocuses, Narcissi,
Chionodoxas, &amp;c., with which they harmonise so well.
Preferring partially shaded spots, they are particularly
valuable for planting in woodland walks, and beneath
our native trees in parks and pleasure grounds. The
hardier kinds require practically no cultivation, and
will flourish in any of the places indicated or in
ordinary garden soil in the rock-garden or flower
border. The best time to plant is about September
and October, and as the bulbs are 1-1/2 to 2 inches in
diameter, they should be buried about 3 or 4 inches
deep, and in hundreds and thousands if possible
instead of in twos and threes.</p>

<p>The best-known member of the genus is undoubtedly
our Common British <a name="Bluebell" id="Bluebell"></a><a href="#INDEX">Bluebell</a> or Wood
Hyacinth (<i>S. festalis</i>). It is to be found in abundance
in woods and copses, and from April to June sends
up its tall stalks of drooping bell-shaped flowers, the
colour of which varies from bluish-purple to white or
pink, according to the several varieties, such as <i>alba</i>,
<i>rosea</i>, and <i>rubra</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Another fine species is the <a name="Spanish_Bluebell" id="Spanish_Bluebell"></a><a href="#INDEX">Spanish Bluebell</a>
(<i>S. hispanica</i> or <i>S. campanulata</i>), perhaps the finest-looking<span class="pagenum">[Pg 122] </span>
Bluebell in the open air. The ordinary
variety has porcelain-blue flowers on stalks a foot or
more high. It is surpassed in beauty, however, by its
white variety <i>alba</i>, which flowers freely and grows
vigorously. There are also forms with pink or rosy
flowers, such as <i>rosea</i> or <i>carnea</i>, <i>rubra</i>, &amp;c., all of
which appear in April and May.</p>

<p>The species, however, that finds so much favour
for autumn planting is <i>S. sibirica</i>, a charming species,
with purple-coated bulbs, and bright porcelain-blue
blossoms with more or less spreading segments.
They appear in February and March on stalks 3 to 6
inches high, but are more numerous in the variety
called <i>multiflora</i> (see <a href="#PLATE_2">Plate 2</a>, fig. 7). Owing to its
early blooming, it is of course a great favourite with
other early flowering plants.</p>

<p>Other kinds of Scilla that may be grown in the
open air in the same way as those already mentioned
are:&mdash;The <a name="Star_Hyacinth" id="Star_Hyacinth"></a><a href="#INDEX">Star Hyacinth</a> (<i>S. amoena</i>), which requires
rather warm sheltered spots. It has bright indigo
blue flowers with spreading segments from March to
May. <i>S. bifolia</i> grows 6 to 9 inches high, and produces
its bright-blue, bell-shaped flowers in March.
There are several forms of it, such as <i>alba</i>, white,
<i>rosea</i>, pale rose, &amp;c. <i>S. hyacinthoides</i>, bluish-lilac;
<i>S. italica</i>, blue; <i>S. verna</i>, porcelain-blue; <i>S. patula</i>,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123] </span>
deep blue with white edges; and <i>S. monophylla</i>, with
blue or violet flowers, all appearing in April and May.</p>

<p>Quite distinct in appearance from all these is <i>S.
peruviana</i>, which, by the way, is not a native of Peru,
but of the Mediterranean region. It has large, pear-shaped
bulbs, and rosettes of leaves 6 to 12 inches long,
with bristly margins. The bright blue starry blossoms
appear in May and June, and are borne in broadly conical
clusters, which elongate during the flowering period.
There are white (<i>alba</i>) and yellow (<i>lutea</i>) varieties,
the first-named of which is shown on <a href="#PLATE_17">Plate 17</a>, fig. 69.</p>

<p>This species may be grown in warm sheltered spots
in the border or rock-garden, in dryish, well-drained
soil. The bulbs should be planted 4 to 6 inches deep,
and in cold localities should be protected from severe
frosts in winter.</p>

<p>Scillas may be increased by offsets taken from the
old bulbs when the foliage has withered.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="SISYRINCHIUM" id="SISYRINCHIUM"></a><a href="#INDEX">SISYRINCHIUM</a> grandiflorum.</b>&mdash;This is the best
garden plant out of about fifty species. Like Schizostylis
coccinea, it can scarcely be called a "bulbous"
plant, as it has only short thickened rootstocks. It
grows about a foot high, having striated leaves, and
deep purple blossoms (as shown in <a href="#PLATE_20">Plate 20</a>, fig. 79),
which, however, are white in the variety <i>album</i>. It is
an excellent plant for the rock-garden, where it should<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124] </span>
be planted in bold clumps, in light sandy loam and
peat. Increased by division of the rootstocks about
September.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="SPARAXIS" id="SPARAXIS"></a><a href="#INDEX">SPARAXIS.</a></b>&mdash;The plant best known under this
name has been already described as <i>Dierama pulcherrima</i>
at <a href="#Page_71">p. 71</a>. The Sparaxis proper are little known
plants, the best known being (i) <i>grandiflora</i>, which
grows 1 to 2 feet high, and has bell-shaped flowers of
deep violet-purple in April and May. There are many
colour variations of this species (including a white
one), several of them having a deeper coloured blotch
at the base of the petals. (ii) <i>Tricolor</i>, resembles
grandiflora in appearance, but has rich orange-red
blossoms with purple-brown blotches on the yellow
base of the petals. There are also several forms of
this species with white, rose, or purple flowers, all
having a yellow centre with distinct blotches at the
base of the petals.</p>

<p>These South African plants require the same
treatment as <i>Dierama pulcherrima</i> or the Ixias (see
<a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>). They like warm sheltered spots in the
mildest parts of the kingdom, and when well-grown
are very showy and useful for cutting.</p>

<p><b><a name="SPREKELIA" id="SPREKELIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">SPREKELIA</a> formosissima</b> (<i>Jacobæa Lily</i>).&mdash;A fine
Mexican plant, with roundish bulbs 2 to 3 inches in
diameter, and narrow strap-shaped leaves 12 to 18
inches long. In the open air the irregular bright<span class="pagenum">[Pg 125] </span>
crimson blossoms, each about 6 inches across, appear
about August, and never fail to attract attention.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Jacobæa Lily, of which there
are a few colour variations, can scarcely be considered
as perfectly hardy in the mildest parts of the British
Islands. It often flowers, however, when the bulbs are
planted out about the end of May or early in June,
when danger from frost is practically over. The
flowers often appear before the foliage, but the bulbs
should not be lifted in autumn for storing until the
leaves show signs of withering. New plants are
secured from offsets.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="STERNBERGIA" id="STERNBERGIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">STERNBERGIA.</a></b>&mdash;Charming plants, with roundish
bulbs about 2 inches in diameter, and strap-shaped
leaves, which are in their prime sometimes with the
blossoms, as in <i>S. lutea</i>, and sometimes long before
the latter appear, as in <i>S. macrantha</i>. The bulbs
should be planted in spring, 5 or 6 inches deep, in
rich and well-drained sandy loam and leaf-soil. When
in bold clumps the flowers present a charming sight,
either in the grass, rock-garden, flower border, or
margins of thin shrubberies. All kinds have beautiful
crocus-like yellow flowers as shown in <a href="#PLATE_33">Plate 33</a>.
<i>S. lutea</i> (fig. 119), variously known as the "Winter
Daffodil" and "Yellow Star Flower," is considered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a>  </span>
be the "<a href="#INDEX">Lily of the Field</a>" mentioned in the Scriptures.
It blooms in September and October, the
yellow flowers nestling amongst the leaves. There
are several forms of it, differing chiefly in the size of
the blossoms and width of the leaves. <i>S. macrantha</i>
(<a href="#PLATE_33">fig. 120</a>) is a still finer species, with flowers much
larger than those of <i>S. lutea</i>, with which they appear
in autumn. Other species are <i>colchiciflora</i>, the bulbs
of which are only about an inch in diameter, and the
pale-yellow sweet-scented flowers appear in autumn.
<i>S. Fischeriana</i> also has bright golden-yellow blossoms,
but differs from its relatives in producing them during
the spring months&mdash;February onwards&mdash;instead of in
the autumn.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="TECOPHILAEA" id="TECOPHILAEA"></a><a href="#INDEX">TECOPHILÆA</a> cyanocrocus.</b>&mdash;This distinct and
charming Chilian plant, popularly known as the
"Chilian Crocus," has fibrous-coated corms and
narrow wavy leaves. The beautiful Violet-scented,
funnel-shaped flowers of a brilliant blue, with a white
centre, appear in March and April, borne in loose
trusses. (See <a href="#PLATE_12">Plate 12</a>, fig. 50.) The variety <i>Leichtlini</i>
differs in having deeper blue flowers than the type,
and without the white centre.</p>

<p>In the milder parts of the kingdom the Chilian
Crocus may be grown in the open air in warm sheltered
spots, such as on a south border at the base of a wall<span class="pagenum">[Pg 127] </span>
or fence. Rich sandy loam and leaf-soil is a good
compost into which the corms may be planted, 6 to 9
inches deep, about September. In winter it may be
necessary to give protection with litter, bracken, &amp;c.,
in the event of severe frosts or continuous cold rains.
The plants are most readily increased by offsets.</p><br>

<p><a name="TIGRIDIA" id="TIGRIDIA"></a><b><a href="#INDEX">TIGRIDIA</a> Pavonia</b> (<i>Peacock Tiger Flower</i>).&mdash;There
are several species of Tiger Flowers, but the one here
mentioned, and its several varieties, are the most useful
for the out-door garden. They have bulbs 1-1/2 to
2 inches in diameter, and plaited Gladiolus-like leaves.
The blossoms, however, one of which is shown on
<a href="#PLATE_30">Plate 30</a>, fig. 110, are of exceptional beauty and
brilliance amongst bulbous plants, and although they
do not last a long time individually, they nevertheless
follow each other so rapidly that the plants are
scarcely ever without flowers during the summer
months. The coloured picture will convey a far better
idea as to the colouring and blotching of the flowers
than any printed description. There are other
varieties of <i>T. Pavonia</i> besides the one shown on the
Plate. Perhaps the best are <i>grandiflora</i>, very large
and brilliant; <i>conchiflora</i>, yellow blotched with purple;
<i>Wheeleri</i>, deep red; and <i>alba</i>, pure white spotted with
purple.</p>

<p>The Tiger Flowers are natives of Mexico, and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 128] </span>
therefore cannot be grown successfully in the open air
in all parts of the kingdom. In the mildest parts, however,
the bulbs may be left in the ground during the
winter months, care being taken to protect them with
leaves, litter, &amp;c., during severe weather, or from
heavy cold rains. In less favoured spots, where they
nevertheless blossom out of doors in summer, the bulbs
may be taken up about the end of October when the
foliage has withered, and they may then be stored in
frost-proof places in sand until the following April or
May. Whenever the bulbs are lifted the offsets
should be detached to increase the stock. The
warmest, most sheltered, and sunniest spot in the
garden is obviously the best place for Tigridias. In
addition to this the soil should be a well-drained sandy
loam enriched with old cow-manure and leaf-soil.
During active growth, and especially in the hot dry
seasons, it is necessary to keep the plants well-supplied
with water, otherwise the results are likely to be the
reverse of satisfactory.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="TRITONIA" id="TRITONIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">TRITONIA</a>.</b>&mdash;This genus contains a handsome
group of plants with fibrous-coated corms, like those
of a Gladiolus, but much smaller. The plants formerly
known as Montbretia are now also included in this
genus, but the corms in some cases (e.g., <i>M. crocosmiæflora</i>)
have slender creeping rhizomes, from which<span class="pagenum">[Pg 129] </span>
new corms are developed by the end of the season.
The leaves are more or less like those of a Gladiolus,
but somewhat narrower, and often curved, while the
showy blossoms are borne in slender graceful spikes,
that are very useful for cutting.</p>

<p>Only a few species and their numerous varieties
are cultivated in the open air, being either massed in
bold clumps in the ordinary flower border or rockery,
or as beds by themselves in the grass. Being natives
of South Africa, warm, sheltered, and sunny situations,
and a light loamy soil, enriched with leaf-soil or well-decayed
manure, naturally suit them best. Although
perfectly hardy in all except the bleakest parts of
the kingdom, the kinds mentioned below are best
taken up and replanted each year or two in the spring
time. It is not, however, essential to lift the corms
in the autumn and store them in sand except in very
cold parts where protection would be troublesome
perhaps. A glance at the drawings on <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a> will
show the reader that offsets are freely produced, and
in this way the kinds are most easily propagated.</p>

<p>The kinds most suitable for open air culture are:
<i>T. crocata</i> (formerly known under the names of <i>Ixia</i>
and <i>Gladiolus</i>) grows about 2 feet or more high,
having broadly sword-shaped and curved leaves, and
spikes of yellow or orange-coloured blossoms in June<span class="pagenum">[Pg 130] </span>
and July. There is a good deal of variation in the
colour, some varieties being much paler or darker
than others, and spotted with red, yellow, or brown.</p>

<p><i>T. crocosmiæflora</i>, better known as <i>Montbretia</i>, is a
graceful and popular garden plant, really a hybrid
between <i>Crocosma aurea</i> (see <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>) and <i>T. Pottsi</i>.
It grows 2 to 2-1/2 feet high, and resembles a small
Gladiolus in foliage. The brilliant orange-red blossoms
appear in great profusion from July onwards to
October or November, and are always attractive when
grown in bold masses. There are numerous varieties
of it&mdash;one, <i>Etoile de Feu</i>&mdash;being shown on <a href="#PLATE_27">Plate 27</a>,
fig. 102; others being <i>Germania</i>, <i>Globe d'or</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>T. Pottsi</i>, also better known perhaps as a
Montbretia, grows 3 to 4 feet high, having narrow
tapering sword-like leaves, and bright yellow funnel-shaped
flowers suffused with red. They are borne in
gracefully nodding spikes from August onwards, and
exhibit great variation in colour and markings
according to the many varieties that are now in
commerce. The plant known as <i>Tritonia aurea</i> is
described in this work as <i>Crocosma</i> (see <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>).</p>

African plant with narrow leaves and slender spikes of
violet-purple flowers, as shown in <a href="#PLATE_32">Plate 32</a>, fig. 113.
This species seems to be hardy in the Thames Valley
and milder parts, but must be grown in large quantities<span class="pagenum">[Pg 131] </span>
to produce anything like an effect. It grows
well in ordinary well-drained garden soil.</p><br>

<p><a name="TULIPA" id="TULIPA"></a><b><a href="#INDEX">TULIPA</a></b> (<i>Tulip</i>).&mdash;Although the days of the
ridiculous Tulip craze of the seventeenth century have
happily passed away, the love of Tulips has increased
by leaps and bounds, and thousands are now cultivated
where formerly dozens or hundreds were tolerated.
Whether grown in lines or circles in formal beds, in
irregular clumps in the flower border or rock-garden,
or naturalised on grassy banks, Tulips constitute one
of the most pleasing and brilliant features in the
garden during the spring and early summer months.
Indeed, one can hardly imagine what the garden would
be like at this period of the year without the beauteous
forms and glorious tints of the Tulip. The well-known
brown-coated bulbs, 1 to 2 inches in diameter, are now
so cheap that they come within the reach of the most
modest purse, and there is no reason why Tulips
should not be found in every cottage garden in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>The culture of the Tulip is quite as easy as that of
the common Daffodil. There is one important
difference, however, between the Tulip and the
Daffodil. While the latter likes partial shade, the
Tulip enjoys plenty of sunshine, and shelter from<span class="pagenum">[Pg 132] </span>
bleak winds. Any good garden soil that has been
deeply dug, and enriched with well-decayed manure
some time previous to planting will produce fine
blossoms. In the open air the bulbs should be
planted about 4 inches deep, and not more than
6, even in bleak localities, as a safeguard against
frost. The best time for planting is from the beginning
of September to the end of October, and care
should be taken when planting formal beds to see that
the lines are perfectly straight, and the bulbs buried
at a similar depth throughout. To secure the latter
result a blunt dibber may be used, marked at the
required depth with a cross-piece nailed on, or a piece
of hoop iron that can be slid up or down to any particular
depth. In this way, and by planting each bed
with the same variety, uniformity in height, colour,
and period of flowering will be secured. In vacant
spaces in the flower border and rock-garden, such
formality would be out of place, and in such positions
mixed Tulips produce a more natural effect.</p>

<p>Although effective in themselves, the beauty of
Tulips is greatly enhanced by planting them in beds
that are already carefully arranged with such plants
as Wallflowers, Polyanthuses, Primroses, Pansies, or
Violas, Dwarf Saxifrages, Double White Arabis,
(<i>A. albida flore pleno</i>), Yellow Alyssum (<i>A. saxatile</i>),
Forget-me-Nots, Aubrietias, and such like plants that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a>  </span>
blossom about the same period and make an effective
screen to hide the ground between the blue-green
leaves of the Tulips. In arranging combinations, it
is as well to have the Tulips and carpet plants
arranged so that the colour of the one shall be quite
distinct and in lively contrast with that of the others.</p>

<p>Thus White Tulips may have Yellow Arabis,
Primroses, Polyanthuses, &amp;c., beneath them. On the
other hand, red Tulips should not be mixed with red
Wallflowers, although they look remarkably effective
with yellow ones. And so on, more or less in accordance
with the principles laid down at <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who take up their Tulip
bulbs each year (when the flowers have withered being
usually the earliest period for this operation) it may
be as well to mention, that the bulb that is lifted about
midsummer, is not the same as that planted in autumn.
Indeed it is quite a new bulb altogether, and, as a
rule, contains all the elements necessary for the production
of leaves and blossoms the following season.
The Tulip bulb planted in autumn is used up in the
formation of leaves and flowers, that are produced
in early summer. Whence then comes the bulb
that is taken out of the soil when the flowering
period is over? It has been made out of the raw<span class="pagenum">[Pg 134] </span>
material that has been assimilated by the leaves
under the influence of sunlight. Very often there is
more than sufficient food for the formation of a large
flowering bulb, in which case the surplus food is converted
into offsets at the base of the large bulb.
These offsets, if planted and grown on for two or
three seasons in specially prepared beds of light soil,
will develop into flowering bulbs. They should, therefore,
never be thrown away as useless.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Seedling_Tulips" id="Seedling_Tulips"></a><a href="#INDEX">Seedling Tulips.</a></b>&mdash;Besides offsets (some of which
drop several inches below the parent bulb, and are
called "droppers.") Tulips may also be raised from
seeds if one has the requisite patience and convenience.
When seeds are required, the old plants must of course
be left in the soil until the seed capsules have
thoroughly ripened. The seeds should be sown very
sparsely in drills, in carefully-prepared beds of light
soil, and may be left undisturbed for about five or
seven years, until the first flowers appear. Of course
weeds must be kept down regularly, and to facilitate
this operation, the seed beds should not be more than
4 or 5 feet wide, and the drills quite a foot apart.</p>

<p>The first flowers of a seedling Tulip are called
"Breeders" or "Mother Tulips" and are of one
colour throughout, although the seeds may have been
saved from beautifully pencilled or flaked blossoms.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 135] </span>
When a "breeder" Tulip develops markings of a
different colour, it is said to "break" or "rectify."
Such rectified flowers are then divided into two
groups, (<i>a</i>) those with a pure white centre, base, or
ground, and (<i>b</i>) those with a pure yellow centre.</p>

<p>The white centred flowers (<i>a</i>) are again divided
into (i) <i>Roses</i>, the flowers of which are various shades
of pink, rose, scarlet, crimson, cerise, &amp;c., and (ii)
<i>Bybloemens</i>, the flowers of which display various shades
of lilac, lavender, violet, purple, brown, purple-black,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The yellow-centred flowers (<i>b</i>) are called <i>Bizarres</i>,
with various shades of orange, scarlet, crimson, purple-black,
brown, &amp;c. These various classes of "rectified"
Tulips have the petals either "feathered" or "flamed."
A "feathered" Tulip has the petals beautifully
pencilled and feathered round the edges only; while
a "flamed" Tulip differs in having bright streaks,
bands, or flames of a distinct colour shooting up the
centre of each petal from the base, and forking out
towards the pencilled and feathered margins.</p>

<p>Only specialists in what are called the "florist's
Tulip," however, take a keen delight in drawing these
distinctions.</p>

<p>There are some hundreds of varieties of Tulips
enumerated in nurserymen's catalogues, but it is
unnecessary to grow many of them to make an<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136] </span>
effective display. The following&mdash;arranged according
to the predominating colour&mdash;may be regarded as a
good selection for planting in the open ground in
autumn:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Darwin Tulips.</b>&mdash;These are a very popular class of
self-coloured Tulips derived from <i>T. Gesneriana</i>. They
are infact "breeder" Tulips referred to on <a>p. 134</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a>  </span>
The individual blossoms are large and cup-shaped, and
are borne on stalks 1-1/2 to 2 feet high. There are
numerous named varieties (for which a catalogue
should be consulted), but a mixed collection will give
a grand display, the colours being shades of apricot,
yellow, carmine, rose, pink, crimson, maroon, and white.</p>

<p>With the <a name="Darwin_Tulips" id="Darwin_Tulips"></a><a href="#INDEX">Darwin Tulips</a> may be associated what
are known as the "Cottage" or "May Flowering"
Tulips&mdash;vigorous kinds with tall stems and fine large
flowers, that are admirably adapted for the decoration
of the garden. For vases, bowls, &amp;c., they are also
excellent.</p>

<p><b>Natural Species or Wild Tulips.</b>&mdash;Apart from the
almost innumerable florists' varieties of Tulips, keen
interest has been taken of late years in the cultivation
of the natural species of Tulip which are found growing
wild in various parts of South Europe, Asia Minor,
Turkestan, &amp;c. There are quite a large number of
these natural species now to be had, but the cream
of them may be said to be <i>Gesneriana</i>, <i>Greigi</i>,
<i>macropsila</i>, and <i>Oculus Solis</i>, all with scarlet or crimson
blossoms and black blotches at the base. Other
useful kinds for bedding out or for naturalising with
Daffodils, Bluebells, &amp;c., are <i>Eichleri</i>, <i>fulgens</i>, <i>Hageri</i>,
<i>macrostyla</i>, <i>maculata</i>, <i>Didieri</i>, <i>Ostrowskyana</i>, <i>planifolia</i>,
<i>lurida</i>, <i>undulatifolia</i>, <i>suaveolens</i>, all with bright red or<span class="pagenum">[Pg 138] </span>
deep crimson blossoms except <i>suaveolens</i> which is bordered
with yellow. Yellow flowered kinds are <i>australis</i>
(<a href="#PLATE_10">Plate 10</a>, fig. 40), <i>Batalini</i>, <i>flava</i>, <i>Billietiana</i>, <i>galatica</i>,
<i>neglecta</i>, <i>retroflexa</i>, <i>sylvestris</i>, <i>strangulata</i> (speckled and
streaked with red), <i>viridiflora</i> (with broad green band
down the centre), <i>Sprengeri</i> (petals tipped with red),
and <i>Kolpakowskyana</i>.</p>

<p>Apart from their value in the garden, Tulips are
also popular as cut flowers. As most of them produce
their blossoms on sturdy stems 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 feet high,
they are easily picked, and when bunched in vases
with foliage, or grasses, or even by themselves, they
add a luxurious appearance to any apartment.</p>

<p>The great mistake many make in picking Tulip
flowers is that they gather them often in the middle
of the day when the petals are wide open, especially
if there is strong sunshine. In the expanded state
the blossoms do not last very long. They should
therefore be picked either early in the morning or
late in the evening, when the petals are closed in over
the stamens and ovary in the centre. There is no
need to actually <i>cut</i> the stems. By holding them
close to the ground and giving a staccato pull upwards,
they come away easily from the bulb, and possess the
advantage of being a few inches longer than those cut
with a knife or scissors.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="WATSONIA" id="WATSONIA"></a><a href="#INDEX">WATSONIA.</a></b>&mdash;Although popularly called "Bugle<span class="pagenum">[Pg 139] </span>
Lilies" the Watsonias really belong to the Iris family.
They have fibrous-coated corms, stiffish, ribbed, sword-like
leaves, and more or less funnel-shaped flowers.
They are indigenous to South Africa, and may be
grown in the open air under much the same conditions
as Ixias, viz., warm, sheltered spots, and in light sandy
soil. In the mildest parts of the kingdom the corms may
be left in the ground during the winter, if necessary,
but they should be protected in severe weather with
litter, &amp;c. In less favoured spots, it is safer to lift
the corms in autumn when the leaves have withered,
and store them in dry soil or sand until the spring.</p>

<p>The varieties depicted on <a href="#PLATE_27">Plate 27</a>, figs. 99 to 101,
show some of the most graceful kinds. <i>W. Meriana</i>,
fig. 99 (also known as <i>Antholyza</i>) has several varieties
including a scarlet one (<i>coccinea</i>), a white one (fig. 100),
and a pink and white one (<i>rosea-alba</i>), which bear their
blossoms during the summer months on stems 2 to 3
feet high. <i>W. rosea</i> resembles a Gladiolus in appearance,
and indeed was once known as <i>G. pyramidatus</i>.
It has several forms, including <i>angusta</i>, shown in the
plate (fig. 101). Perhaps the most charming variety of
all, however, is the beautiful <i>Ardernei</i>, the large pure
white blossoms of which always attract attention
owing to their purity and delicacy (<a href="#PLATE_26">Plate 26</a>, fig. 96).</p>

<p>As a pot plant for conservatory decoration,
<i>W. Ardernei</i> is very valuable, owing to its graceful<span class="pagenum">[Pg 140] </span>
appearance. In the open air it requires warm,
sheltered, and sunny positions, and a rich sandy soil.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="ZEPHYRANTHES" id="ZEPHYRANTHES"></a><a href="#INDEX">ZEPHYRANTHES</a></b> (<i>Zephyr Flower</i>).&mdash;Beautiful
plants with small brown-coated bulbs about an inch
in diameter, from which spring narrow leaves and
rather large funnel-shaped flowers, only one, however,
on each stem. There are only a few species that may
be grown in the open air in the mildest parts of the
kingdom. The soil cannot be too well drained, and
should consist of a rich sandy loam, while the position
should be the warmest and most sheltered in the
garden. The kinds most likely to succeed are
<i>Atamasco</i>, a native of the damp woods and fields of
Virginia. The flowers shown on <a href="#PLATE_29">Plate 29</a>, fig. 106,
are at first pure white, but become tinted with pink
or purple. <i>Z. candida</i>, the "Swamp Lily" of La
Plata, has pure white blossoms, as shown on
<a href="#PLATE_32">Plate 32</a>, fig. 114, as have also <i>Treatiæ</i> and <i>tubispatha</i>,
while <i>carinata</i> and <i>rosea</i> both have rose-coloured
flowers. The average height of these kinds
is about a foot, and they may be increased from
offsets or from seeds. At one time the Zephyr
Flowers were grown in warm greenhouses, but
experience has proved that they are much hardier
than was at first supposed.</p>

<h2><a name="ENEMIES_OF_BULBOUS_PLANTS" id="ENEMIES_OF_BULBOUS_PLANTS"></a><a href="#INDEX">ENEMIES OF BULBOUS PLANTS.</a></h2><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 141] </span></p>



<p>Bulbous plants are subject to the attacks of
various insect and fungoid pests in the same way as
other plants are, and steps should be taken to free
the plants from them whenever they appear, or to
prevent them appearing at all.</p>

<p>It is easier to carry out the latter recommendation
when insect enemies only are to be dreaded, but it is
quite another matter with fungoid diseases, the
presence of which is only revealed when they have
reached the "fruiting" or spore stage, and have
already done a certain amount of mischief.</p><br>

<p><b><a name="Wireworms_Grubs" id="Wireworms_Grubs"></a><a href="#INDEX">Wireworms, Grubs,</a> &amp;c.</b>&mdash;When a soil is infested
with any of these pests, the gardener may be almost
sure to find his choicest roots or bulbs eaten by them.
He should, therefore, take the precaution to have the
ground turned up, if possible, some time before planting,
so that these pests may be brought to the surface
and exposed to the keen eyes of the "birds in the
air" who are always on the watch for any choice
morsels that are likely to improve their voices.</p>

<p>It would not be safe, however, to trust altogether
to the natural enemies of these pests who are
usually endowed with keen powers for evading
their attacks. It may be necessary, therefore, to lay
traps of pieces of potato, carrot, parsnip, or any fleshy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a>  </span>
and enticing material in their haunts, and examine
them regularly. A piece of stick thrust into these
substances will make a convenient handle for lifting
them up for examination. The best time of course to
catch the enemy is when he is dining off his piece of
potato, parsnip, or carrot. He and his friends should
then be led forth for execution beneath the weight of
the foot, or into a bucket of boiling water, or in any
other way that the ingenious reader may devise. The
main thing, however, to bear in mind is that the
enemy must be <i>killed</i> without mercy or remorse. And
no matter how ruthlessly he is persecuted, it will be
found each season that there are still some of his
family left to carry on a guerilla warfare against the
gardener and his plants. So that one must be really
always on the watch for attack, and, like a wise
general, be ready to meet it, or spoil it altogether.</p>

<p>Besides using traps of potatoes, carrots, &amp;c.,
<i>nitrate of soda</i> and <i><a name="kainit" id="kainit"></a><a href="#INDEX">kainit</a></i> have been found very useful
for ridding the soil of these pests. About 2lbs. of
nitrate of soda or kainit to a square rod (30-1/4 square
yards) has been found an ample dressing. It should
be distributed evenly over the surface of the soil,
when the latter is in a moist&mdash;but not sodden&mdash;condition.</p>

<p><a name="Lime_and_Soot" id="Lime_and_Soot"></a><a href="#INDEX"><b>Lime and Soot</b></a>.&mdash;Slugs and snails are great
marauders among the young growths of bulbous and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 143] </span>
other plants, and may be kept in check by the use of
nitrate of soda, and kainit, as well as by birds.
These remedies may be supplemented, or even supplanted,
by the use of lime and soot. These substances
are always easy to obtain, and will be found
of great use not only in keeping the garden free from
insect pests, but also because of their manurial value.</p>

<p>When lime is used for checking the attacks of
slugs or snails it should be freshly slaked, that is, a
little caustic or quick-lime should be broken down
into a fine white powdery mass by having a little
water poured over it. When the heat has subsided
the powdered lime may be sprinkled around and
between the crowns of the plants that are being
attacked by slugs. Should it come in contact with
the slimy bodies of these it will soon kill them. Soot
that has been exposed to the air for several weeks will
be found a good preventive also against these pests,
and it has the advantage of not being so conspicuous
amongst the plants as lime. Fresh soot from the
chimney should on no account be strewn amongst the
young crowns or growths of plants, as the poisonous
matters in it may kill them as well as the slugs.</p>

<p>Slaked lime and seasoned soot may be mixed
together, and then strewn over the surface of the soil.
Even common <a name="salt" id="salt"></a><a href="#INDEX">salt </a>is a good slug destroyer, and may
be applied in either a liquid or solid form. Lime-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a>  </span>
is also an excellent cleanser, and may be given to the
soil freely without injury to the plants. Where large
numbers of Daffodils are grown one must keep a
watch for the grub of the <a name="Narcissus_fly" id="Narcissus_fly"></a>Narcissus fly (<i><a href="#INDEX">Merodon</a>
equestris</i> or <i>Narcissi</i>), an insect resembling a small
and slender bumble-bee in appearance. It lays its
eggs in the early summer months in the Narcissi, and
the grubs from these bore their way into the fleshy
part of the bulb, damaging the growths and flower
stems for next season. When the bulbs are being
lifted or planted, any that are soft to the touch are
very likely affected, and should be examined for the
pest. Any badly affected should be burned. Those
not so badly injured may be steeped in water in July
or August, for about a week, to drown the maggots
which at this period have caused but little mischief.
When the perfect Merodon insects are on the wing
from about the middle of May to the middle of July
they may be enticed to drown themselves in saucers
containing strong solutions of sugar or treacle, placed
amongst the plants.</p>

<p>Although most birds in the garden may be looked
on with a friendly eye, one must make an exception
in the case of <i>Passer domesticus</i>,&mdash;otherwise known as
the common <a name="sparrow" id="sparrow"></a><a href="#INDEX">sparrow</a>. He will tear your Crocuses&mdash;- especially
the yellow ones&mdash;to tatters out of sheer
mischief. If he would only eat the petals or make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a>  </span>
nest of them there would be some excuse; but no, he
simply tears them to pieces and flings them, so to
speak, in your face. Mrs. Sparrow is no doubt just
as bad, and therefore should have her nest and the
eggs therein confiscated and destroyed on every
possible occasion. A few strands of <i>black</i> cotton
thread stretched over the Crocuses will be found to
yield a certain amount of protection against attack.</p><br>

<p><b><a href="#INDEX">Fungoid Diseases.</a></b>&mdash;Of the fungoid diseases affecting
bulbous plants happily there are few; and even these are
not troublesome to any alarming extent in the open air.</p>

<p>Snowdrops are sometimes attacked with a kind of
mildew known scientifically as <i>Botrytis galanthina</i>.
The fungus attacks bulbs, leaves, and flower-stems one
after the other, and effectually stops the plants from
flowering. As soon as this disease is seen on the
plants, the affected portions should be carefully
picked off and burned. Once the disease reaches the
black spot-like stage, there is little hope for the plants
so that they had better be burned straight away.</p>

<p>Colchicums, Crocuses, Tulips, Hyacinths, Daffodils,
Gladioli, and others are affected from time to time
with one fungoid disease or another, probably because
the soil in which they grow has not been particularly
well-prepared, and is full of some organic matter that
can only be disposed of by the addition of freshly-slaked
lime, and deep digging at the earliest opportunity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a>  </span>
When any of the plants referred to are badly
attacked with any fungoid disease, the simplest and
best remedy is to burn them&mdash;and thus kill the spores
and prevent them spreading. It will be cheaper to
buy new bulbs the following season, and to grow
them in <i>another</i> portion of the garden, rather than
try to reclaim the old ones whose doom in any case
is only a matter of time.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the worst <a href="#INDEX">diseases</a> affecting bulbous
plants is that which for some years past has
ravaged plants of the <a href="#INDEX">Madonna Lily</a> (<i>Lilium candidum</i>).
The bulbs seem to be fairly free from the
disease, but the leaves and stems become so badly
affected in some parts of the country that they cannot
perform their functions, with the result that no
blossoms are borne, or only misshapen ones. There
is at present, I believe, no effectual remedy against
the Lily disease, and once it appears in a garden, the
culture of the Madonna Lily is doomed from that
moment. As a preventive, the plants might be
sprayed several times during the season, from January
onwards, with a solution made by dissolving one ounce
of <a name="liver_of_sulphur" id="liver_of_sulphur"></a><a href="#INDEX">liver of sulphur</a> in a gallon of hot water, and adding
2-1/2 gallons more of water. This should be applied
with a fine-sprayed syringe, and is a good preventive
against many kinds of fungoid attacks. If used near
white woodwork and comes in contact with it, the
paint will be discoloured. Of late years, the bulbs<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147] </span>
that are imported in such large numbers from Japan
have been more or less afflicted with a fungoid disease
that appears to be very difficult to check. This
disease may be the result of over cultivation, or too
intense cultivation to secure large quantities of plants
in a comparatively short time. The Bermuda Lily
disease is probably the result of similar efforts to get
rich too quickly. So that one natural remedy against
the disease would be to grow the bulbs more naturally
and allow them to ripen fully before disturbing them.
However, as people in Europe must have Lilies, they
take the best that can be provided. On arrival of the
bulbs they should be carefully examined, and any
diseased or decayed portions taken off and burned.
As a preventive against any spores germinating, the
bulbs may be well rolled in freshly slaked lime, and
allowed to dry in a cool airy place for a day or two
before planting or potting. Mr. Massee, in his book
on "Plant Diseases," recommends submerging the
bulbs in a 1 per cent. solution of <a name="salicylic" id="salicylic"></a><a href="#INDEX">salicylic acid</a> for
20 minutes, and after thoroughly drying them, to kill
the spores of the fungus.</p>

<p>A peculiar fungoid disease, known as "<a name="basal_rot" id="basal_rot"></a><a href="#INDEX">basal rot,</a>"
attacks Daffodils and Narcissi in soil that is cold and

brown at the tips, and the bulbs to become rootless<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148] </span>
and swollen, while the tunics are soft and rotten
at the base. The best way to check this disease is to
have the bulbs lifted, and if they can only be grown
in the same soil again, this should be deeply dug to let
the water pass away from it, and some road grit and
leaf-soil should be incorporated with it before re-planting.
Some freshly slaked quicklime may be
afterwards pricked into the top with the fork.

<h2><a name="MANURING_BULBOUS_PLANTS" id="MANURING_BULBOUS_PLANTS"></a><a href="#INDEX">MANURING BULBOUS PLANTS.</a></h2>


<p>When bulbous plants, like Tulips, Hyacinths,
Daffodils, &amp;c., are planted and lifted annually, they
can hardly be said to require any special manuring
during the period of their growth, as the soil in which
they are planted is, or ought to be, usually well prepared
and manured in advance in the way recommended
at <a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>. But even when such bulbs are
planted and lifted every year, they might be considerably
improved by the application of a little artificial
manure at the right time. For instance, in
December or January a little <a name="basic_slag" id="basic_slag"></a><i><a href="#INDEX">basic slag</a></i> (10 to 20
pounds to about 30 square yards) would supply phosphatic
food to roots later on in the season when it
would be useful for the development of the blossoms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a>  </span></p>

<p>A little <i><a href="#INDEX">superphosphate</a> of lime</i> at the rate of four to
eight pounds to 30 square yards, would also be useful,
applied about March or April. <i><a name="Kainit149" id="Kainit149"></a><a href="#INDEX">Kainit</a></i> is a cheap
potash manure, and may be applied at the same time
as the basic slag at the rate of one or two pounds to
the same area&mdash;either by itself or mixed with the slag.</p>

<p>It contains a good deal of common salt, and should
therefore be applied <i>before</i> root-action commences,
otherwise it may prove injurious to the new roots.</p>

<p>The necessity for manuring becomes more important
in the case of bulbous plants that are to be left
in the same soil for several years. Like other plants,
of course, they rob the soil of a certain amount of food,
and unless this is returned in some way the soil
gradually becomes poorer and the plants less vigorous.
One of the best ways, perhaps, to supply fresh food
for the roots of the bulbous plants is to give the soil a
good top-dressing or mulching of well-decayed manure
in the early autumn months. This will gradually
decay during the ensuing winter and spring months
and yield up its food. During this period it will
also prevent the heat, that was taken into the
soil in the summer, from escaping too rapidly by
radiation. It would be more harmful than useful to
apply a mulching of manure in the depth of winter or
early spring, as it would prevent the sun's rays from
warming the roots.<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 150] </span></p>

<p>Where Lilies, Tulips, Daffodils, Crocuses, Snowdrops,
and many other kinds of bulbous plants are
naturalised in the grass, in flower borders, or amongst
trees and shrubs, a good dressing of well-decomposed
manure in the early autumn will prove highly beneficial
each year. The basic slag, kainit, and superphosphate
may be also applied at the seasons
mentioned, if considered desirable.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
